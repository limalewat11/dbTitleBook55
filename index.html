Trump is undoubtedly a menace, but he isn&#x2019;t a surprise. He embodies the spirit of an age of folly abandoned to conspicuous consumption of vanity and greed. A self-glorifying photo-op, Trump is made to the measure of an infotainment media in which presidential candidates are game show contestants brought to judgment on election day before the throne of cameras by whom and for whom they are produced.<br><br> To regard Trump as an amazement beyond belief is to give him credit where none is due, to mistake a symptom for the cause. Trump&#x2019;s presence in the White House follows from an American regime change over the last twenty-five years during which a weakened but still operational democracy gave way to a stupefied and dysfunctional plutocracy.<br><br> The history of that change is a hedge against the despair of the present, making possible the revolt against what G. K. Chesterton called &#x201c;the small and arrogant oligarchy of those who merely happen to be walking about.&#x201d;</p></p><p><b>Lewis H.

Even within one country, she traverses decades to suggest titles that effortlessly capture the different eras that make up a region&#x2019;s unique history. This enthusiastic literary globetrotting guide includes stops in Korea, Sweden, Afghanistan, Albania, Parma, Patagonia, Texas, and Timbuktu.&nbsp; <i>Book Lust To Go</i> connects the best fiction and nonfiction to particular destinations, whether your bags are packed or your armchair is calling. From fiction to memoir, poetry to history, Nancy Pearl&#x2019;s Book Lust to Go takes the reader on a globetrotting adventure &#x2014; no passport required.</p><p>Nancy Pearl created the program "If All of Seattle Read the Same Book," which has spread across America and around the world. She talks about books and reading on NPR&#x2019;s "Morning Edition" and on other public radio stations. Pearl teaches at the University of Washington and inspires readers across the country. She is the author of several books, including <i>Book Lust, More Book Lust,</i> and <i>George &amp; Lizzie. </i>Pearl lives in Seattle with her husband.With the holidays just around the corner, Nancy Pearl's little gem will please many a traveler (or dreamer) who loves to read about faraway places but doesn't know where to start. With fanciful alliteration, Pearl lists titles under topics arranged from "A is for Adventure" to "Zipping through Zimbabwe." Recommendations are accompanied by brief critiques and insights. In an entry for "Las Vegas," for example, Pearl recommends Chris Ewan's novel, The Good Thief's Guide to Vegas, for fans of Hiaassen and Westlake, capers that use various cities of the world for their settings. Pearl classifies her recommendations well enough so that readers can take or leave her advice. In "Africa," for instance, she includes the classic Cry the Beloved Country as well as contemporary mysteries such as Wife of the Gods. It might have been easy to stick with the country structure for a book like this, but Pearl mixed it up, to good effect, with chapters like "So We/I Bought (or Built) A House In..." which includes books about homes in Morocco, Mexico, France, Brazil, and Ireland. Pearl has produced a winner and the perfect bedside companion. (Oct.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Barricaded in their crumbling house, surrounded by the festering rubbish of years, they defy the curiosity of their neighbors and their social worker, Isabel Field. Isabel is young and inexperienced and has troubles of her own: an elderly father who wanders the streets, and a lover, Colin, who wants her to run away with him. But Colin has three horrible children and a shrill wife who is pregnant again--how is he going to run anywhere? As Isabel wrestles with her own problems, a horrible secret grows in the darkness of the Axon household. When at last it comes to light, the result is by turns hilarious and terrifying.</p></p><p><p>Hilary Mantel is the critically acclaimed author of eight novels, seven of which are available in paperback from Henry Holt. Winner of the Hawthornden Prize, she lives in England. Ms. Mantel reviews for The New York Times and the New York Review of Books.</p>EVERY DAY IS MOTHER'S DAY<p>When Mrs. Axon found out about her daughter's condition, she was more surprised than sorry; which did not mean that she was not very sorry indeed. Muriel, for her part, seemed pleased. She sat with her legs splayed and her arms around herself, as if reliving the event. Her face wore an expression of daft beatitude.</p><p>It was always hard to know what would please Muriel. That winter, when the old man fell on the street and broke his hip, Muriel had personally split her sides. She was in her way a formidable character. It wasn't often she had a good laugh.</p><p>Click, click, click, said the mock-crocs. They were Mrs. Sidney's shoes. She passed without mishap along the Avenue, over that flagstone with its wickedly raised edge where Mr. Tillotson had tripped last winter and sustained his fracture; they had petitioned the council. Mrs. Sidney's good legs, the legs of a woman of twenty-five, moved like scissors down the street. Her face was white and tired, her scarlet lips spoke of an effort at gaiety. She had carried the colour over the line of her thin lips, into a curvaceous bow; she had once read in a magazine that this could be done. Of what lies between the good legs and the sagging face, better not to speak; Mrs. Sidney never dwelled on her torso, she had given it up. She stopped by the house called "The Laburnums," by the straggling privet hedge spattered white with bird-droppings and ravaged by amateur topiary; and tears misted over her eyes. She wore the black coat with the mink trim.</p><p>Arthur had been with her when she bought the coat. It was budgeted for; the necessity had been weighed. Arthur had been embarrassed, standing among the garment rails; he had clasped his hands behind his back like Prince Philip, and with his eyes elsewhere he tried to look like a man deep in thought. She had not trailed him around the shops, she knew what she wanted. "A good coat," she said to him, "a good cloth coat is worth every penny you spend on it."</p><p>She had tried on two, and then the black. The salesgirl was sixteen. She was not interested in her job. She stood with one limp arm draped over the rail, her hip jutting out, watching Mrs. Sidney push the laden hangers to and fro. She did not know anything about the cut of a good cloth coat. Mrs. Sidney removed her gloves, and her fingers stroked the little mink collar appreciatively. She had tried to engage Arthur's attention, but he was not looking, and for a second she was shot through with resentment. Carelessly she tossed her old camelhair over a rail; until this morning it had been her best coat, but now it seemed shabby and inconsiderable. She unfastened the buttons carefully, slipped her arms into the silky lining. Turning to see the back in the long mirror, she smiled tentatively at the salesgirl. "Do you think the length...?"</p><p>The girl raised her thin shoulders in a shrug.</p><p>By now Arthur stood smiling at her indulgently, his hands still clasped behind his back.</p><p>"I will take it," Mrs. Sidney said. She minced towards Arthur.</p><p>"Very nice, dear," Arthur said. "Are you sure you've got what you wanted?"</p><p>She nodded, smiling. He would have been willing, she knew, to pay twenty pounds more, once he had agreed on the economy of a good cloth coat. Arthur did not stint. The girl laid it out by the cash register, flapped some tissue between its crossed arms and slid it, folded, into a big bag. Arthur took out a virgin chequebook, and his rolled-gold fountain pen. Precisely, he unscrewed the cap; smoothly, the ink flowed; with care, he replaced the cap and returned the pen to the inside pocket of his lovat sports jacket. Then, with a single neat pull, he removed the cheque and handed it courteously to the girl. Mrs. Sidney was proud of that, proud of the way the transaction had been carried through; how they did not pay in greasy bundles of notes like plumbers and housepainters. The carrier bag was heavy, with the good cloth coat inside it, and Arthur reached out without speaking and took it from her. He asked about a hat, so anxious was he to have everything correct; but she told him that people do not go in so much for hats nowadays. To be truthful, millinery departments intimidated her. The assistants looked at you scornfully, for so few of the people who tried on hats ever made a purchase; they had lost faith in human nature. She was happy. They had a cup of coffee and a cream cake each, and then they went home.</p><p>That night Arthur had his first stroke. When she got up in the morning, all the right side of his body was paralysed, and his mouth was twisted down at the corner; he couldn't speak. By eight o'clock he was lying on a high white bed at the General. She was sitting outside the ward, drinking the strong tea a nurse had given her out of a chipped white cup. All she could think was, you can get these cups as seconds on the market. Could that be where they get them? A hospital, could it be? He's on the free list, the nurse said, you can come at any time. When she went to see him he moved restlessly those parts he could move; he never again knew what day of the week it was, or anything at all about the world in the corridor or the market-place beyond. He suffered his second stroke while she was there, and they put lilac screens around the bed and informed her that he had passed away. She wore the black coat to his funeral.</p><p>Mrs. Sidney raised one elegant knee a little, to prop her bag on it, fumbled inside and took out a pink tissue. Standing by the stained and formless privet, she dabbed her eyes. She looked for a litterbin, but there were none in the Avenue. She screwed the tissue back into her handbag and scissored along the street.</p><p>The Axons' house stood on a corner. There was a little gate let in between the rhododendrons. No weeds pushed up between the stones of the path. And this was odd, because you would not have thought of Evelyn Axon as a keen gardener. There was stained glass in the door of the porch, venous crimson and the storm-dull blue of August skies. Mrs. Sidney stopped a pace from the door. She feared her nerve was going to fail her. Again she fumbled with her bag, patting for her purse to make sure it was still there. She did not know whether Mrs. Axon accepted payment. A small tickle of grief and fear rose up in her throat. She arrived at her decision; Mrs. Axon would already be watching from some window in the house. She placed her finger on the doorbell as if she were buttonholing the secret of the universe. It did not work.</p><p>But somewhere, in the dark interior of the house, Evelyn moved towards the door. She opened it just as Mrs. Sidney raised her hand to knock. Mrs. Sidney lowered her arm foolishly. Evelyn nodded.</p><p>"Come in," she said. "I suppose you want to speak to your late husband."</p><p>It was a nice detached property. As soon as she entered the hall behind Evelyn, Mrs. Sidney's eyes became viper-sharp. She took in the neglected parquet floor, the umbrella stand, the small table quite bare except for one potplant, withered and brown.</p><p>"Nothing seems to survive," Evelyn said.</p><p>Mrs. Sidney took a tighter grip on her bag.</p><p>"And into the front parlour," Evelyn said.</p><p>Then she kept her eyes on Evelyn's fawn cardigan, the bulky shape moving weightily ahead. It was a sunless room, seldom used; at this time Evelyn lived mostly at the back of the house. There were heavy curtains, a round dining-table in some dark wood, eight hard chairs with leather seats; a china cabinet, and two green armchairs placed at either side of the empty fireplace. "You'll want the fire," Evelyn said; she was nothing if not a good hostess. Mrs. Sidney took one of the armchairs, knees together, her handbag poised on them. Evelyn shuffled out and left her alone. She stared at the china cabinet, which was quite empty.</p><p>Evelyn returned with a little electric fire, two bars, dusty, the flex fraying. "If you don't mind," Mrs. Sidney said, "that's dangerous. Bare wires like that."</p><p>Evelyn slammed the plug firmly into the socket. As she stood up, she gave Mrs. Sidney what Mrs. Sidney called a straight look, the kind of look that is given to people who speak out of turn. "Make yourself comfortable, Mrs. Sidney," she said.</p><p>Once again, Mrs. Sidney was struck by the cultured tone of Evelyn's voice. She was, had been, what old-fashioned people called a lady. She and her husband had lived in this house when these few dank autumnal avenues were the best addresses in town. The Axons had always kept to themselves. For years the neighbours had complained about Evelyn's ways, about the odd times at which she hung out her washing, about her habit of muttering to herself in the queue at the Post Office. Yet, Mrs. Sidney thought, she was a cut above. In a way she was a very tragic woman; Mrs. Sidney had a nose for tragedy these days, alerted to it by her own. "You'll have to excuse my not providing tea," Evelyn said. "It's not convenient. I'm not going into the kitchen today." Mrs. Sidney blinked. For want of reply, her eyes slid back to the empty china cabinet.</p><p>"Smashed," Evelyn said. "All smashed years ago."</p><p>Evelyn went over to the sideboard. It was, Mrs. Sidney noted, the most modern piece of furniture in the room. It had one of those compartments for drinks, and a flap that came down to serve them on. Evelyn pulled it down. Mrs. Sidney gaped. She could make out the labels from here; baked beans, salmon, ox-tongue. Evelyn reached into the back and took out a half-full bottle of orange squash. From a cupboard, she took two glasses and poured a careful measure into each. On the table stood a jug of lukewarm water. Evelyn set down one of the glasses by her guest's side, and took the armchair opposite.</p><p>"I expect you will want to talk about him a little," she said. She sat upright and alert, watching her visitor, noting how the face-powder had caked at the side of her nose, how the open pores of her cheeks shone, how the body mocked the pretty, lively legs. And suddenly Mrs. Sidney crumpled, as if she had been dealt a blow; her bag slid from her knees to the floor, her shoulders sagged, great gouts of grief came dropping from her mouth. Yes, Evelyn thought, how they steer you to cheerful topics; how after twice meeting they cross the road and pretend that they didn't see you so that they can avoid the whole embarrassing encounter: a widow. There is, Evelyn reflected, a custom known as Suttee; to judge by their behaviour, many seemed to think its suppression an unhealthy development.</p><p>She watched. Mrs. Sidney's mouth worked, and the scarlet line of lipstick above her top lip contorted independently of the mouth, so that her face seemed to be slipping in and out of some grotesque and ludicrous mask. The woman lurched forward; her hands scrabbled for her bag and she scrubbed at her face with the pink tissues and dropped them in sodden balls on the carpet and onto the chair. Evelyn reached for her orange juice and took a sip. She put down the glass carefully, on a mat with a fringe. "Mr. Sidney was a good husband to you," she suggested.</p><p>Mrs. Sidney talked about the buying of the coat, of the cakes they had eaten, of the vast corridors of the hospital with its draughts and swinging firedoors; the stained walls, the starched impatience of doctors' coats and the dreadful grimace of his paralysed mouth. As she talked she gasped and retched at the memories, but in the end she calmed herself, sat upright and shaking on the edge of the chair, her legs crossed tightly and her eyes formless and red. She was ready to begin.</p><p>"Mr. Sidney's line of work was with the Transport Authority," she said carefully. She spoke as if each of her words was a precious crystal glass coming out of a crate; one slip could shatter her again.</p><p>"You mean the bus company?" Evelyn said.</p><p>"It was a kind of insurance work. When--if, you see, there was an accident, someone was in an accident on the bus, he would be finding out what happened and deciding how much the bus--the Transport Authority--ought to pay out for it. He was called a Claims Investigation Agent."</p><p>"Yes," Evelyn said. "He was a clerk. I understand. Now I will tell you, Mrs. Sidney, sometimes I meet with success and sometimes I don't. If you would call it success; I would say, results. It appears that they tell some people that all is very beautiful on the ninth plane and that there are flowers and organ music, but they never said that to me, and if they do say it I think they must be confusing it with the funeral. It would be a natural mistake. On those grounds, I hardly approve of cremation."</p><p>"But do you ever," Mrs. Sidney hesitated, "do you ever speak with your own husband?"</p><p>"Clifford died in 1946," Evelyn said. "He was a quiet man, and I suppose we have less in common than we did."</p><p>"What did--did he pass over suddenly?"</p><p>"Very suddenly. Peritonitis."</p><p>There was a silence. Mrs. Sidney broke it with difficulty. "Do you use a wineglass?"</p><p>Evelyn snorted. "If you want that, you get it at parties, don't you?"</p><p>"I'm sorry," Mrs. Sidney said. She stood up. "Mrs. Axon, I'm sorry, I don't think I should have come. If my daughter knew she'd kill me."</p><p>"And your curiosity would be satisfied," Evelyn said. "How old are you, Mrs. Sidney?"</p><p>"Since you ask, I'm sixty-five."</p><p>Evelyn sighed. "Not a great age, but you ought to know what to expect. If I were you, I'd sit down, and we can get on."</p><p>Mrs. Sidney sat. She stared about her, hypnotised by her own temerity, by Evelyn's watery blue eyes, by the dull sheen of the afternoon light on the hard leather chairs.</p><p>Presently Evelyn leaned forward, her hands clasped together, her eyes closed, and scalding tears dropped from under her lids. Mrs. Sidney watched them falling. Her heart hammered. Evelyn's mouth gaped open, and Mrs. Sidney dug her nails into her palms, expecting Arthur's voice to come out.</p><p>Evelyn dropped back in her chair. Her pale eyes snapped open, and she spoke in a perfectly normal voice.</p><p>"I told you not to come to me for reassurance, Mrs. Sidney. Go to the Spiritualist Church if you like. It's in Ruskin Road. They have a cold buffet afterwards." She got heavily to her feet. Mrs. Sidney lurched after her, past the empty china cabinet and the dead potplant, stumbling to the door.</p><p>"Mrs. Sidney," Evelyn said, "your husband Arthur is roasting in some unspeakable hell."</p><p>She closed the door. I shall give this up, she thought. They come here, for a Cook's Tour of the other world; as if it were in some other but accessible place, they use me like an aero-plane, like a cruise liner. But it was here, a little removed yet concurrent; each day some limb of the supernatural reached out to pluck you by the clothes. I shall give it up, she thought, because it is making me ill; if one day I took some sort of fit and were laid up, what would happen, who would look after Muriel?</p><p>AXON, MURIEL ALEXANDRA</p><p>DATE OF BIRTH: 4*4*40</p><p>2 BUCKINGHAM AVENUE</p><p>Miss Axon was visited at her home by Miss Perkins of this Department on 3*3*73 and subsequently by CWD on 15*3*73.

These stories took the form of letters of remission, documents narrated to royal notaries by admitted offenders who, in effect, stated their case for pardon to the king. Thousands of such stories are found in French archives, providing precious evidence of the narrative skills and interpretive schemes of peasants and artisans as well as the well-born.<br>This book, by one of the most acclaimed historians of our time, is a pioneering effort to us the tools of literary analysis to interpret archival texts: to show how people from different stations in life shaped the events of a crime into a story, and to compare their stories with those told by Renaissance authors not intended to judge the truth or falsity of the pardon narratives, but rather to refer to the techniques for crafting stories.<br>A number of fascinating crime stories, often possessing Rabelaisian humor, are told in the course of the book, which consists of three long chapters. These chapters explore the French law of homicide, depictions of "hot anger" and self-defense, and the distinctive characteristics of women's stories of bloodshed. <br>The book is illustrated with seven contemporary woodcuts and a facsimile of a letter of remission, with appendixes providing several other original documents. This volume is based on the Harry Camp Memorial Lectures given at Stanford University in 1986.</p><p>"Natalie Zemon Davis's articles . . . have already earned her a reputation among those familiar with her work as one of the most brilliant and original historians active in American today.

From ancient India and ancient Greece, medieval France and Enlightenment America, up to the latest controversies over gay marriage and cloning, natural orders have been enlisted to illustrate and buttress moral orders. Revolutionaries and reactionaries alike have appealed to nature to shore up their causes. No amount of philosophical argument or political critique deters the persistent and pervasive temptation to conflate the &#x201c;is&#x201d; of natural orders with the &#x201c;ought&#x201d; of moral orders.</p><p>In this short, pithy work of&nbsp;philosophical anthropology, Lorraine Daston asks why we continually seek moral orders in natural orders, despite so much good counsel to the contrary. She outlines three specific forms of natural order in the Western philosophical tradition&#x2015;specific natures, local natures, and universal natural laws&#x2015;and describes how each of these three natural orders has been used to define and oppose a distinctive form of the unnatural. She argues that each of these forms of the unnatural triggers equally distinctive emotions: horror, terror, and wonder. </p><p>Daston proposes that human reason practiced in human bodies should command the attention of philosophers, who have traditionally yearned for a transcendent reason, valid for all species, all epochs, even all planets.</p></p><p>Lorraine Daston is Director at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin and Visiting Professor in the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago. She is the coauthor (with Katharine Park) of <i>Wonders and the Order of Nature, 1150&#x2013;1750</i> and (with Peter Galison) <i>Objectivity</i> and the editor of <i>Things that Talk: Object Lessons from Art and Science</i>, all three published by Zone Books.<p>Lorraine Daston poses an insightful question: Why have human beings persisted in trying to read the moral order from the order of nature? In elegant prose, wearing learning lightly, she offers a fascinating historical tour and a deft philosophical analysis, arriving at an original and brilliant answer.</p>&#x2015;<b>Philip Kitcher</b>, John Dewey Professor of Philosophy, Columbia University</p><h2>Dominion</h2><p>C.J.

The film depicts the rise of newly rich oil barons as they replaced and came into conflict with the old cattle aristocracy. And yet the movie also teems with characters that depict racist stereotypes of Mexicans. One&nbsp;scene, this memory, is at the heart of <i>Scene from the Movie GIANT, </i>a remarkable book-length poem in five parts by Tino Villanueva. Villanueva excavates the meaning of this scene and in doing so grapples with urgent questions of cultural identity.</p><p><p>Tino Villanueva (born December 11, 1941, San Marcos, Texas) is an American poet and writer.</p>At first, the movie Giant (1956) might seem like a strange symbol on which to base an entire book of poetry. But Giant is a pop culture landmark, mainly because of the larger-than-life status of stars Rock Hudson, James Dean, and Elizabeth Taylor. For Latino poet Villanueva, Giant also serves as an archetype of Anglo treatment of Mexican Americans. The scene that obsesses him, from his 14th year onward, involves the expulsion of a Mexican American family from a hamburger joint owned by a crude racist. For Villanueva, the scene is replayed "up and down the wide screen/ Of memory," revealing every ugly facet of racism and intolerance. Villanueva is a rare talent, able to combine art and politics into one powerful document where he is caught "like a still photograph." Recommended for large collections.<br><i>- Daniel L.

Carolyn McCormick delivers the first-person narrative of Katniss, the heroine whose brilliant strategy in that book thwarted tradition and turned her and her partner, Peeta, into victors. McCormick&#39;s phrasing is clipped, almost staccato, a style that embodies Katniss&#39;s secretive, wary attitudes. The tension builds as the oppression of the controlling President Snow inflames rebellion in Katniss and her fellow citizens. At the climax McCormick narrates at a breakneck pace as Katniss and Peeta compete against all previous winners of the combat tournament. Listeners will be eager for the next installment. S.W.

She also managed her own consulting company, providing genealogical research services. In addition to genealogy, Sheila loves restoring old houses, visiting cemeteries, and traveling.

She is married and has one daughter and three cats.<p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p>Meg Corey walked to the edge of the orchard, stopping where the land sloped downward to her house below, and turned to study her trees. It was March and just over a year since she had first arrived in Granford to take up residence in a house she&#x2019;d seen only once before in her life, and she almost laughed now to remember just how na�ve she had been at the time. Of course, she had also been kind of stunned by the turns her life had suddenly taken back then: no job, no boyfriend, no place to call home. So Meg had blindly followed her mother&#x2019;s suggestion to park herself in Granford, a tiny town in western Massachusetts, while she figured out her next move. Her mother, Elizabeth Corey, might even have used the words &#x201c;find yourself.&#x201d; Meg hadn&#x2019;t had the energy either to argue with her mother or to come up with a better idea, so she had moved into the drafty old house, which lacked insulation and adequate heating, in the midst of a cold New England winter. She&#x2019;d been miserable.</p><p>What a difference a year had made! Meg hadn&#x2019;t even known there was an apple orchard on the property when she arrived, and now it was her livelihood. She could look at it and tell what tasks needed to be done now that it was early spring, before buds and leaves and apples began to form. She&#x2019;d harvested a decent crop in the fall, despite a rather scary summer hailstorm, and had sold the apples for a profit. They&#x2019;d had a string of good weather this month and had taken advantage of it to do housekeeping chores in the orchard&#x2014;picking up the pruned twigs, turning over the soil as soon as it thawed. As Meg watched, Briona Stewart, her young orchard manager and housemate, appeared in the orchard lugging a bundle of prunings from the trees. There was always something to be done: broken limbs had to be propped up or heartlessly sawn off, fertilizer had to be applied before growth began, and there was the cycle of spraying&#x2014;nontoxic!&#x2014;to be factored in. Bree added her trimmings to a growing pile; there were people around the area who liked to use apple wood to scent their fires, and if they were willing to pay a couple of bucks for a bundle of discards, who was Meg to argue with them? Last year&#x2019;s weeds had been cleared away, and everything looked neat and trim. Meg felt an unexpected surge of excitement. What kind of crop could she hope for this year? She still didn&#x2019;t know her trees well enough to tell; she was still learning to distinguish among the modern stock and the scattered heirloom varieties that were increasing in popularity, at least in this rarified gourmet patch of western Massachusetts. But she had learned so much in only a year!</p><p>Meg had also decided she liked living in Granford&#x2014;certainly well enough to stay for a second year, and maybe even longer. She was beginning to feel like the town, whose population hovered around thirteen hundred people, was home; she&#x2019;d found friends and neighbors . . . and Seth Chapin, who was both of those and more, although they were both still shy of sticking a label on whatever they shared. She was, she dared to think, happy.</p><p>She waved at Bree, who waved back, then Meg turned around to admire her house. It was a sturdy white Colonial with some ramshackle extensions added over the more than two centuries since it had been built by members of the Warren family&#x2014;her ancestors. Now she knew who who they were, had traced the adze marks on the hand-hewn timbers, and could say, &#x201c;My great-great . . . grandfather did that, he and his sons.&#x201d; They&#x2019;d built to last, and here she was, trying to keep the place intact. Structurally it was sound, but she&#x2019;d had to replace the plumbing and the heating systems in the past year, and she was going to have to work hard to pay off those charges on her groaning credit card. This year she really had to think about getting the roof replaced, and the trim cried out for a coat of paint. But that would all come after the orchard work.</p><p>Originally the house had faced the large barn, presumably with space&#x2014;or chicken coops or pig pens or privies&#x2014;between, but since this was New England, some of her forebears had built a series of connecting structures between the house and barn so they could reach the barn without freezing off various essential body parts. Nearest was an open shed, where she and Bree parked their cars and stacked firewood&#x2014;and junk. Next was a more substantial two-story building that a hundred years earlier had been a carpenter&#x2019;s shop and which now housed Seth Chapin&#x2019;s building renovation business. His office was on the second floor, and the first floor&#x2014;and a portion of the adjoining barn&#x2014;were filling up with his miscellaneous building supplies and salvage. Seth was definitely a hoarder when it came to architectural bits and pieces, but Meg had to admit that the mantels and doors he picked up from who knows where looked far too good to send to the dump, and she was sure he would find them all a good home eventually.</p><p>She spied Seth standing in the middle of the driveway, talking to a woman she didn&#x2019;t recognize. Meg began to make her way down the hill, watching her footing. A warm March meant mud, and she&#x2019;d learned better than to come up the hill in anything but sturdy muck boots. That lesson had come after more than one slide on her backside.</p><p>It took her a minute or two to reach the two of them, and they were so engrossed in what looked like a rather heated conversation that they didn&#x2019;t even notice her approach. She hesitated to interrupt but then reminded herself that they were standing on her property and she had every right to be there. &#x201c;Hi, Seth,&#x201d; she called out from a few feet away.</p><p>Their conversation stopped abruptly, and both turned to look at her. Meg had been right: she didn&#x2019;t know the woman. She was closer to forty than thirty, and if it had been another era Meg would have labeled her a hippie who had wandered down from Vermont: her clothes were an odd mix of whimsical and practical, and her long fair hair was held back by a faded bandanna. Meg noticed that under her long cotton skirt, the woman also wore muck boots much like Meg&#x2019;s own. She looked peeved at having been interrupted.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, Meg,&#x201d; Seth answered. He didn&#x2019;t seem anywhere near as rattled as the woman, but it took a lot to rattle Seth Chapin. &#x201c;Do you know Joyce Truesdell? Joyce, this is Meg Corey&#x2014;she owns this place.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;ve met. Hi, Joyce&#x2014;I&#x2019;d shake, but my hands are kind of dirty.&#x201d;</p><p>Joyce smiled reluctantly. &#x201c;So are mine&#x2014;probably worse. I&#x2019;m a dairy farmer. Let&#x2019;s take it as a given.&#x201d; Having observed the social conventions, Joyce turned back to Seth. &#x201c;Look, Seth, this is my livelihood. If that land is making my cows sick, it&#x2019;s on the town&#x2019;s head. I&#x2019;ve got the results of the blood work already, and I sent soil samples off to the lab at the university for testing at the same time, and I expect those results any day now. If I find out that the land is tainted, when you and the town swore it was fine, you&#x2019;re going to hear about it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Joyce, I know you&#x2019;re upset,&#x201d; Seth said patiently, &#x201c;but I swear, this is the first I&#x2019;ve heard about your problem. Let me do some research and I&#x2019;ll get back to you in a couple of days. You know as well as I do that the town records are stashed all over town, and it may take me awhile to track down what we need to look at. But I will get back to you, one way or the other. The town must have pulled the records when they leased the land to you. I&#x2019;ll find them.&#x201d;</p><p>Joyce sighed. &#x201c;I know you will&#x2014;you&#x2019;re one of the few people I can trust to keep his word. I know this isn&#x2019;t your fault, but it&#x2019;s so damn frustrating. Just when I think I&#x2019;m getting a little bit ahead, something starts making my cows sick! I can&#x2019;t seem to catch a break. Remind me again why I got into this business?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because you like milk?&#x201d; Seth joked.</p><p>&#x201c;I like cows. They don&#x2019;t talk back,&#x201d; Joyce responded. &#x201c;Call me when you know anything. Nice to meet you, Meg&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve been meaning to introduce myself for a while, but I never seem to have any free time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know the problem. Good to meet you, too, Joyce.&#x201d;</p><p>Joyce stomped off to her aged pickup truck. The door had a logo on it, something with a cow. Silently, Meg and Seth watched Joyce pull away.</p><p>&#x201c;What was that about?&#x201d; Meg finally asked.</p><p>&#x201c;If you offer me a cup of coffee, I&#x2019;ll tell you all about it. It&#x2019;s not hush-hush. If anything, it&#x2019;s a public matter, involving her land, or rather, the land she leases from the town.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Coffee I can do. I might even have some cookies, if Bree hasn&#x2019;t eaten them all. But she does work hard, so I guess she earns them. She certainly burns it off.&#x201d;</p><p>Meg led Seth through the back door into the kitchen and put a kettle on to boil. Seth dropped into one of the chairs at the well-scrubbed round oak table in the middle of the room. &#x201c;How&#x2019;re things coming?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Looking good, I think, and Bree agrees. The trees held up pretty well over the winter, even with all the snow we had. She&#x2019;s doing an inventory now, but she didn&#x2019;t seem too worried. Sometime in here I&#x2019;m going to have to decide if I want to expand&#x2014;if I put in new trees now, it&#x2019;s still going to be a few years before they bear.&#x201d;</p><p>The kettle boiled, and Meg set about putting ground coffee in her French press and adding the water. When the coffee was ready, she filled two mugs and sat down across from Seth. &#x201c;So, what&#x2019;s Joyce&#x2019;s story? I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve seen her around before, not that I get out all that much myself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She runs a small dairy operation, maybe thirty or forty head, on the north side of town, just before the ridge this side of Amherst. She grazes all her cattle on the pastures there. It&#x2019;s really a labor of love for her. She used to be a federal dairy inspector, but she decided that she&#x2019;d rather be a producer than a bureaucrat, so she and her husband Ethan bought a nice piece of land, with a house and milking barn. She sells organic raw milk and makes some cheese. The regulations for selling raw milk&#x2014;and calling it organic&#x2014;are pretty specific, but she knows the ropes.&#x201d; He stopped to take a swallow of coffee.</p><p>&#x201c;So what was she complaining about? And why did she come to you? Apart from your recognized role as Granford&#x2019;s own Mr. Fixit, not to mention an elected selectman.&#x201d; She smiled at him.</p><p>Seth grinned back. &#x201c;A couple of years ago Joyce decided she wanted to expand the operation, give herself a little more cushion, without adding staff and facilities. So she came to the town and leased some pasturage that the town owns, and she spent a year improving the field, mostly getting rid of weeds and invasive plants and adding some good feed grass, before turning any cows loose on it. She was thinking long term and she did it right, plus the town gave her a good rate for it, since we weren&#x2019;t using the land anyway. So, a couple of weeks ago she let out some of her cows for the first time&#x2014;you should see a herd of cows the first time they get out into a field in the spring! They frolic, there&#x2019;s no other word for it&#x2014;and anyway, they&#x2019;d only been out a couple of days when some of them started getting sick, and one died, so she pulled them off the field. She came to me to complain, since I&#x2019;m on the town&#x2019;s board of selectmen, and I can&#x2019;t say that I blame her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a shame. Any idea what the problem is?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not at the moment. The land hasn&#x2019;t been used for anything for decades, and even though you think I know everything there is to know about Granford, I haven&#x2019;t memorized the history of each plot of land here. I wasn&#x2019;t just stalling when I told her that I&#x2019;d have to do some digging before I could tell her anything about the history of that parcel.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You said the records are scattered all over? Not at town hall?&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled ruefully. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve seen town hall&#x2014;it used to be a mansion for some people from Boston who came out summers to enjoy the country air. It was never intended to be a municipal building. There are a lot of files shoved into the basement, which at least is dry, but I have a feeling that what I need to check goes back quite a ways. We&#x2019;ve put the archived documents wherever we can find space, much like the Historical Society does. It&#x2019;ll take me a few days to track down whatever went on with that field. Since the town owns it, there must be some kind of story behind it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Have you known Joyce long?&#x201d; Meg asked, getting up to freshen her cup. &#x201c;You want more coffee?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please.&#x201d; Seth held out his mug as Meg poured. &#x201c;Not that long. Neither she nor her husband grew up around here, but she knows the area pretty well. She did her homework when she picked her location, and she&#x2019;s got a good local reputation for her milk. You&#x2019;ve probably eaten some of her cheese at Gran&#x2019;s.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to ask Nicky the next time I&#x2019;m in the restaurant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Speaking of using land, have you considered my offer?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which one?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d be happy to let you use some of my land to expand your orchard.&#x201d;</p><p>Meg had been putting off giving Seth an answer because she was torn. In part it was a business decision: did it make financial sense for her to expand? If so, how much? It had taken awhile to get the numbers assembled and to review them with Bree, and the answer had been a tentative &#x201c;yes&#x201d; to the expansion. But the more complicated issue was, did she want to enter into that kind of commitment with Seth? She&#x2019;d only just started to really feel like they were dating . . . using his land for a long-range purpose felt akin to making a public statement that they were together for the long haul. And although Meg was cautiously optimistic about the relationship, she wasn&#x2019;t quite ready to make that kind of declaration. Still, whether or not to expand the orchard was something she would have to decide soon, before the window for planting closed.</p><p>&#x201c;Let me get back to you on that, okay?&#x201d;</p><p>Seth eyed her a minute before he shrugged and said, &#x201c;Okay. It&#x2019;s up to you, and I have no other plans for the land. But I&#x2019;d like to see it put to good use.&#x201d;</p><p>Was he disappointed? &#x201c;Let me talk to Bree about it, now that we know what&#x2019;s survived the winter. So, anything else going on?&#x201d; she said to change the subject.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s the Spring Fling this weekend.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s right&#x2014;you were a little preoccupied around this time last year. It&#x2019;s a party that we hold each year to celebrate the arrival of spring, since by now everybody&#x2019;s usually got a serious case of cabin fever. It&#x2019;s not fancy&#x2014;we hold it in the high school gym&#x2014;but we&#x2019;ve got a good local cover band who plays the kind of stuff most people like, and there&#x2019;s food and dancing, and raffles and prizes. Half the town turns out. Will you come?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you asking me to be your date?&#x201d; Meg tried to keep a straight face.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course. But my mother may tag along to chaperone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, then, I guess it&#x2019;s a good thing I like your mother.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Brooklyn Interiors</h2><p>Brooklyn today fosters creative communities as never before, and they have cultivated a renegade approach to style&#x2014;one rooted in broad-minded eclecticism and independence. <i>Brooklyn Interiors</i> roams through twenty-four homes that embody this spirit&#x2014;from brownstones and row houses to lofts and apartments.

Delving deep into the latest management texts informing the thinking of employers, the authors trace the contours of a new spirit of capitalism. They argue that beginning in the mid-1970s, capitalism abandoned the hierarchical Fordist work structure and developed a new network-based form of organization founded on employee initiative and autonomy in the workplace&#x2014;a putative freedom bought at the cost of material and psychological security. This was a spirit in tune with the libertarian and romantic currents of the period (as epitomized by dressed-down, cool capitalists such as Bill Gates and Ben and Jerry) and, as the authors argue, a more successful, pernicious, and subtle form of exploitation.<br><br> In this new edition, the authors reflect on the reception of the book and the debates it has stimulated.</p></p><p><b>Luc Boltanski</b> teaches sociology at the EHESS, Paris.

Moving between Cornish-based artist colonies and the London art scene, stylistically Tuke presents a fusion of progressive <i>plein airisme</i>, loose impressionistic handling, and a vivid palette, and yet he was fundamentally an academic painter of exhibition nudes. Though consistently successful throughout his lifetime, in the wake of two world wars Tuke&#x2019;s depictions of bathing boys came to represent a seemingly outmoded epoch. This far-reaching study features new research from leading authorities on Victorian and Edwardian art, including Kenneth McConkey and Michael Hatt. Essays tackle questions of wide-ranging artistic influences, experimental art practice, and a varied reception history. Tuke&#x2019;s repeated portrayal of adolescent male nudes provokes challenging questions about the depiction, exhibition, and reception of the body&#x2014;especially the young body&#x2014;both then and now.</p><p>This volume explores how as an artist and as an individual Tuke navigated the shifting artistic, social, and sexual factors of his time.<b>Cicely Robinson</b> is Brice Curator at Watts Gallery&#x2013;Artists&#x2019;&nbsp;Village in Surrey, England.</p><h2>The Song of Songs: Love Lyrics from the Bible (HBI Series on Jewish Women)</h2><p>Striking in its appeal to the senses, the Song of Songs&#x2015;the Bible&#x2019;s only book of love poems&#x2015;is remarkable for its lack of sexual stereotyping and its expression of mutuality in relationships between men and women.

Yet as he has come to be studied more closely in recent decades, a number of different Eckharts have emerged. This volume reviews and synthesizes the diverging views of Eckhart that have been presented in recent past. For the first time, Bernard McGinn, the greatest living scholar of Western Christian mysticism, brings together in one volume the fruition of decades of reflection on these questions, offering a view of Eckhart that unites his reflections as preacher, philosopher, and theologian.</p><p>Bernard McGinn is one is of the greatest living authorities on Catholic historical theology. The Naomi Shenstone Donnelly Professor (Emeritus) of historical theology and history of Christianity at the University of Chicago, McGinn holds a Ph.D. from Brandeis University and an S.T.L. from the Pontifical Gregorian University. McGinn has lectured on and written extensively about the history of apocalyptic thought and recently has focused his attention on the fields of spirituality and mysticism. His current long-range project is a seven-volume history of Christian mysticism in the West called The Presence of God."A wonderful book on one of the most original thinkers of medieval Europe. Scholarly and eminently readable." -- <i>Niklaus Largier, UC Berkeley</i><br><br>&#x201c;Today no one in America knows Eckhart better than Bernard McGinn.

In fact, the majority of society does not even believe in objective truth. A minister out of touch with this culture is like an uninformed missionary trying to teach in a foreign country. To communicate God's Word effectively in the twenty-first century, teachers need to know how to connect with and confront an audience of postmodern listeners. <br><br>In Preaching to a Postmodern World, Johnston shows pastors, seminary students, professors, lay teachers, and church leaders can reach the present age without selling out to it.

The legendary Rough Riders &#x2014; an unlikely combination of cowboys, frontiersmen, Native Americans, African-Americans, and Ivy League alumni &#x2014; trained in Texas before shipping off to Cuba. The regiment met their enemy in the tropical summer heat, fighting rain, mud, and malaria as well as the Spanish Army. Their battles climaxed with the assault on San Juan Hill, where Colonel Roosevelt rallied his troops to charge through a hail of gunfire to victory.<br>From Roosevelt's own pocket diary comes this gripping account of the Rough Riders' heroism. Published to instant acclaim in 1899, the year after the regiment's triumphant return from Cuba, it solidified the author's popularity and helped pave his way to the White House.

Abraham Lincoln, who had been involved in more than three thousand cases&#x2014;including more than twenty-five murder trials&#x2014;during his two-decades-long career, was hired to defend him. This was to be his last great case as a lawyer.<br><br>What normally would have been a local case took on momentous meaning. Lincoln&#x2019;s debates with Senator Stephen Douglas the previous fall had gained him a national following, transforming the little-known, self-taught lawyer into a respected politician. He was being urged to make a dark-horse run for the presidency in 1860. Taking this case involved great risk. His reputation was untarnished, but should he lose this trial, should Harrison be convicted of murder, the spotlight now focused so brightly on him might be dimmed. He had won his most recent murder trial with a daring and dramatic maneuver that had become a local legend, but another had ended with his client dangling from the end of a rope.<br><br>The case posed painful personal challenges for Lincoln. The murder victim had trained for the law in his office, and Lincoln had been his friend and his mentor. His accused killer, the young man Lincoln would defend, was the son of a close friend and loyal supporter. And to win this trial he would have to form an unholy allegiance with a longtime enemy, a revivalist preacher he had twice run against for political office&#x2014;and who had bitterly slandered Lincoln as an &#x201c;infidel...too lacking in faith&#x201d; to be elected.<br><br><em>Lincoln&#x2019;s Last Trial</em> captures the presidential hopeful&#x2019;s dramatic courtroom confrontations in vivid detail as he fights for his client&#x2014;but also for his own blossoming political future. It is a moment in history that shines a light on our legal system, as in this case Lincoln fought a legal battle that remains incredibly relevant today.<br><br><strong>Look for Dan Abrams and David Fisher&#x2019;s latest book, </strong><strong><em>Theodore Roosevelt for the Defense</em></strong><strong>, coming in May 2019.</strong></p><p><b>Dan Abrams </b>is the CEO and founder of Abrams Media and chief legal affairs anchor for ABC News.

Of these, the six colonies in the Caribbean&#x2014;Jamaica, Barbados, the Leeward Islands, Grenada and Tobago, St. Vincent; and Dominica&#x2014;were among the wealthiest. These island colonies were closely related to the mainland by social ties and tightly connected by trade. In a period when most British colonists in North America lived less than 200 miles inland and the major cities were all situated along the coast, the ocean often acted as a highway between islands and mainland rather than a barrier.</p><p>The plantation system of the islands was so similar to that of the southern mainland colonies that these regions had more in common with each other, some historians argue, than either had with New England. Political developments in all the colonies moved along parallel tracks, with elected assemblies in the Caribbean, like their mainland counterparts, seeking to increase their authority at the expense of colonial executives. Yet when revolution came, the majority of the white island colonists did not side with their compatriots on the mainland.</p><p>A major contribution to the history of the American Revolution, <i>An Empire Divided</i> traces a split in the politics of the mainland and island colonies after the Stamp Act Crisis of 1765-66, when the colonists on the islands chose not to emulate the resistance of the patriots on the mainland. Once war came, it was increasingly unpopular in the British Caribbean; nonetheless, the white colonists cooperated with the British in defense of their islands. O'Shaughnessy decisively refutes the widespread belief that there was broad backing among the Caribbean colonists for the American Revolution and deftly reconstructs the history of how the island colonies followed an increasingly divergent course from the former colonies to the north.</p></p><p>Andrew Jackson O&#39;Shaughnessy is the Saunders Director of the Robert H.Smith International Center for Jefferson Studies at Monticello and Professor of History at the University of Virginia.<p>Chapter One<br>British Sojourners</p><p>At the outset of the American Revolutionary War, a French visitor remarked on the differences between the island and mainland colonies of British America: "Far from settling in the islands," the white colonists regarded them "as a land of exile, never as a place where they plan to live, prosper, and die." In contrast, the Anglo-American colonists of the mainland were "permanent, born in the country and attached to it; they have no motherland save the one they live in."</p><p>Writing a century earlier, a Barbadian planter spoke of this umbilical attachment in which "by a kind of magnetic force England draws all to it.... It is the center to which all things tend. Nothing but England can we relish or fancy." In 1760, Charles Townshend favorably contrasted West Indians to North Americans because they "never consider[ed] themselves at home" in the islands and they sent "their children to the Mother Country for education." They eventually returned to Britain "to recover their health or enjoy their fortunes" for, if they had ambition, "tis hither they come to gratify it."</p><p>In 1764, following the end of the Seven Years' War, a Nevis author reflected on the transient quality of white society in the islands: "Tho' detained from their native land by mercenary Pursuits and Views of Interest, yet [they] consider their Absence from Britain as an Exile, and incessantly sigh for a return." Upon joining his regiment in Jamaica, Lord Adam Gordon commented that "the generality of its inhabitants look upon themselves there as passengers only." Bryan Edwards similarly described how "it is to Great Britain alone that our West India planters consider themselves as belonging." He added that "even such of them as have resided in the West Indies from their birth, look on the islands as their temporary abode only, and the fond notion of being able to go home (as they emphatically term a visit to England) year after year animates their industry and alleviates their misfortune."</p><p>Colonists throughout British America spoke of Britain as their home. The expression was more meaningful in the British West Indies, however, where the white settlers were primarily a society of sojourners who aimed to return to Britain and identified themselves culturally with Britain. I shall argue that the strength of the social and cultural ties with Britain restrained the development of a nationalistic creole consciousness among whites and was a contributory factor in the failure of the British Caribbean to support the American Revolution.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Whites in the British Caribbean were creoles, if we mean simply that they made cultural adaptations to their new environment. Like European settlers elsewhere in the Americas, they possessed distinctive characteristics in their speech, diet, dress, architecture, values, and behavior that were peculiar to the Caribbean. They developed an attachment to their islands, which was reflected in the numerous prerevolutionary local histories and a literature praising the tropical landscape. They were often ambivalent about their British identity when they actually returned to the mother country.</p><p>But West Indian whites were not committed to permanent settlement, and their ideal of returning home to the mother country gave white society a transient quality. They treated the islands as little more than temporary abodes to facilitate their spectacular reentry into British society. Throughout the eighteenth century, an increasing proportion of West Indian planters returned to live off the income of their plantations as absentees in Britain. The trend varied among islands, often in relation to the respective expansion and profitability of sugar production. It began in Barbados soon after the Restoration of Charles II (1660). In the last two decades of the seventeenth century, some three hundred west Indians were annually going back to Britain "with this advantage that their fathers went out poor and the children come home rich." Over one-third of Jamaican planters were absentees by 1740.</p><p>In the 1730s, absenteeism was still quite rare in the Leeward Islands (Antigua, St. Kitts, Montserrat, and Nevis). Thereafter it reached chronic levels in St. Kitts, where absentees owned half the property in 1745. Absenteeism was also prevalent in the Windward Islands (Grenada, St. Vincent, Dominica, and Tobago) from the time of their acquisition by Britain in 1763. Tobago had only twenty resident planters out of a total of seventy-seven proprietors. Absentee estates in Grenada were worth upward of a million pounds of sterling in 1778.</p><p>On the eve of the American Revolution, planter-historian Edward Long estimated that there were some two thousand nonresidents, annuitants, and proprietors, "who of late years" and "beyond the example of former times" had flocked from Jamaica to Britain. A visitor found St. Kitts "almost abandoned to overseers and managers, owing to the amazing fortunes that belong to Individuals, who almost all reside in England." Absentees made up 80 percent of the elite families of Antigua, and two-thirds of the planters in Jamaica were absentees by 1800. Absenteeism was also common among military officers, the clergy, and patent officeholders.</p><p>These British sojourners consequently bequeathed shamefully little toward developing an infrastructure in the islands, such as schools, colleges, roads, and missions. The most enduring visible monuments to the presence of the British in the Caribbean were those commemorating the deaths of individuals who died before achieving their ambition of returning home. Some were crafted by the best English sculptors, such as Henry Cheere and John Bacon. They all shared a common feature in the complete absence of any depiction of tropical life in the West Indies. The patrons clearly wanted to be commemorated by monuments exactly like those of an English country churchyard. These decaying monuments remain English corners of a foreign land.</p><p>The transience of white West Indian society was reflected in the paucity of architectural remains. Edward Long spoke of the "make-shift" appearance of the architecture in Jamaica, and Bryan Edwards described the "meanness of their houses and apartments." There were "few of the Beauties of Architecture to be seen in Jamaica" despite the opulence of its planters. James Anthony Froude, a nineteenth-century historian, was appalled at the difference between Kingston, the largest town in the British West Indies, which "has not one fine building in it," and Havana, the Spanish capital of Cuba, which "is a city of palaces, a city of streets and plazas, of colonnades and towers, and churches and monasteries." The most impressive architectural eighteenth-century legacies were not private residences but fortresses, naval dockyards, and military barracks. "We English," Froude concluded, "have built in those islands as if we were but passing visitors, wanting only tenements to be occupied for a time."</p><p>West Indian fortunes nurtured several noted writers and scholars, but they too were often sojourners. They included bibliophiles, historians, political pamphleteers, constitutional authorities, political economists, travel writers, natural historians, botanists, and agricultural commentators. There were West Indian members of the Royal Society, the Dilettante Society, and the Royal College of Physicians. The first complete oratorio in the Americas was composed and performed in Jamaica in 1775. There were also poets, landscape artists, actors, architects, and connoisseurs. Spanish Town in Jamaica had a theater, circulating libraries, a literary society, an agricultural society, and social clubs in the 1770s. West Indian literary and artistic work may indeed have "fostered local pride," but most of these authors and scholars were either visitors, temporary residents, or absentees. They also were often transients, thereby creating the popular misconception that "in literature, science and the arts, the history of the British West Indies is almost a blank."</p><p>It was the ephemeral nature of white settlement that so concerned Edward Long, the most incisive of contemporary commentators. His History of Jamaica (1774) pleaded for greater self-sufficiency and the development of local institutions. He advocated legislative action to fund schools, a medical college, white immigration, improved military defenses, and a stronger church foundation. His emphasis on greater self-sufficiency was his most original intellectual contribution "not his political ideas per se" or his "constitutionalism." However, even Long succumbed to the temptations of absenteeism and returned to Britain.</p><p>Only in Barbados did the British come close to developing a creole society of committed settlers in the Caribbean. This was due to the high proportion of whites, less reliance on immigration, the belief that the climate was more healthy, lower rates of absenteeism, lower sugar profits, lower rates of "miscegenation," less danger from foreign attack (owing to the windward position), and complacence about the threat of a black rebellion. Barbados contained the largest proportion of small and middling planters, numbering some four thousand resident landowners in 1765. It had a better infrastructure with the oldest assembly in the British Caribbean, the first printing press, schools in every parish, the first newspaper, and a well-supported Anglican Church.</p><p>Barbados has been used as a case study to show the early development of a creole mentality in the eighteenth-century British Caribbean. Even in Barbados, however, the white population was in a minority. Almost one-third of the planters were absentees like Samuel Estwick, Philip Gibbes, John Gibbons, and the Lascelles. The Barbadian elite preferred to be educated in Britain; thus Codrington College never "promised to make it unnecessary for Barbadian youths to travel to England for advanced education." It closed as a school between 1775 and 1786 and was not a university or even a seminary until 1830. The yeoman class of small landholders lacked the confidence to politically challenge the planter elite until the early nineteenth century.</p><p>* * *</p><p>How do we explain the transience of British society in the Caribbean and the almost universal desire of whites to return home to Britain? Frank Wesley Pitman argued that the absence of religious motives among the first English settlers in the Caribbean created a transient society, which was in contrast to North America, where religion inspired ideals of a new society divorced from England. He also suggested that the settlers in the islands were drawn from "the capitalist class . . . [who] were often connected with the landed gentry, were Anglicans, and championed the social and political conceptions held by the rural aristocracy of England," in contrast to the North Americans, "who came largely from the middle and nonconformist class in England . . . [and who] had imbibed democratic and republican ideas."</p><p>Pitman, in an error common among his generation, treated the history of colonial America as synonymous with the Puritan colonies of New England and ignored the more populous plantation colonies of the Chesapeake (Virginia and Maryland). There was in reality little difference in the motives and background of the early English emigrants to the Caribbean from those of the Chesapeake. The plantation colonies of the islands and the southern mainland shared a common ethos, which was materialistic, individualistic, competitive, exploitative, and comparatively secular. It was the universal aim of most settlers in all the plantation colonies to make quick fortunes and to return to a life of genteel leisure in Britain.</p><p>The peculiar transience of British society in the Caribbean can be attributed in part to demographic failure. The white population was not sustained by natural increase, unlike the mainland colonies where the white population was doubling every twenty-five years after 1700. Deaths exceeded births in the Caribbean. The migration of a little under half a million Europeans to the British Caribbean was "roughly comparable" to that of British North America before the American Revolution. Yet there were fewer than fifty thousand whites in the British Caribbean, compared to two million in North America, in 1776.</p><p>The demographic failure of white society in the islands was linked to the high mortality rates: "The low life expectancy of white men in the tropics goes far to explain the large number of absentee proprietors" and the small size of the white population. Jamaica was "considered the most unhealthy [place] . . . in the world." Over one-third of white immigrants died within three years of arriving in the Caribbean. A posting in the islands consequently occasioned sudden rises in the military sick lists and even mutinies in the army in Britain. Being stationed in Jamaica became a form of punishment. The danger of sudden death was a constant topic of conversation among passengers on a voyage to the West Indies in 1775. Hector St. John de Cr�vecoeur wrote of West Indians who at the age of thirty were "loaded with the infirmities of old age" and losing the "abilities of enjoying the comforts of life at a time when we northern men just begin to taste the fruits of our labour and prudence." The grim prospect of a premature death was a powerful deterrent to living in the Caribbean.</p><p>Influenced by the humoral theory of medicine, European settlers feared, above all, the tropical "climate of our sugar islands," which they found "so inconvenient for an English constitution that no man will choose to live there, much less will any man choose to settle there [in the Caribbean]." They blamed the heat for causing high mortality rates, but in reality, the majority fell victim to malaria and less commonly to the more lethal yellow fever epidemics. Whites had less immunity to these diseases than did blacks.</p><p>The high mortality rates of native whites were a cause of fragile family formations that also contributed to the transience of white society. Premature deaths cut short marriages, which typically lasted little more than eight years in Jamaica. The majority of children died in infancy or in childhood. The size of families was consequently very small.</p><p>Even so, British immigrants continued to be a major component of white society in the Caribbean. Opportunities were good in the professions and in trades, owing to the demographic failure of the native white population, the lack of skilled white artisans, and the limited educational infrastructure within the islands. Furthermore, Jamaica and some of the Windward Islands were still frontier settlements with uncultivated land before the American Revolution.</p><p>Young white immigrant males from Britain were a dominant element in the white population of Jamaica. Their presence contributed to the unbalanced sex ratios and compounded the problem of fragile family formations. There was "a whole parish [in Jamaica] without a married Man" and another parish where there was "not to be found above one married couple." Young British males who arrived as indentured servants were often more highly skilled than those of the southern mainland colonies.</p><p>The Scots were the second largest group of immigrants after the English.

He is the recipient of the Northern California Book Award, the California Book Award, the New York Public Library Young Lions Award, the O Henry Award for Short Fiction, and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York Public Library. Greer lives in San Francisco.<p>We think we know the ones we love. <br>Our husbands, our wives. We know them&#x2014;we are them, sometimes; when separated at a party we find ourselves voicing their opinions, their taste in food or books, telling an anecdote that never happened to us but happened to them. We watch their tics of conversation, of driving and dressing, how they touch a sugar cube to their coffee and stare as it turns white to brown, then drop it, satisfied, into the cup. I watched my own husband do that every morning; I was a vigilant wife.<br>We think we know them. We think we love them. But what we love turns out to be a poor translation, a translation we ourselves have made, from a language we barely know. We try to get past it to the original, but we never can. We have seen it all. But what have we really understood?<br>One morning we awaken. Beside us, that familiar sleeping body in the bed: a new kind of stranger. For me, it came in 1953. That was when I stood in my house and saw a creature merely bewitched with my husband&#x2019;s face.<br>Perhaps you cannot see a marriage. Like those giant heavenly bodies invisible to the human eye, it can only be charted by its gravity, its pull on everything around it. That is how I think of it. That I must look at everything around it, all the hidden stories, the unseen parts, so that somewhere in the middle&#x2014;turning like a dark star&#x2014;it will reveal itself at last.The story of how I met my husband; even that&#x2019;s not simple. We met twice: once in our Kentucky hometown, and once on a beach in San Francisco. It was a joke for our whole marriage, that we were strangers twice.<br>I was a teenager when I fell in love with Holland Cook. We grew up in the same farming community, where there were plenty of boys to love&#x2014;at that age I was like those Amazonian frogs, bright green, oozing emotion from every pore&#x2014;but I caught no one&#x2019;s eye. Other girls had boys falling over them, and although I did my hair just like them and ripped the trim off attic dresses and sewed it on my hems, it did no good. My skin began to feel like clothing I had outgrown; I saw myself as tall and gawky; and as no one ever told me I was beautiful&#x2014;neither my mother nor my disapproving father&#x2014;I decided that I must be plain.<br>So when a boy came along who actually met my eyes, who showed up along my walk from school and got himself invited in for a slice of bread, I didn&#x2019;t know what to make of him. I could tell he wanted something. For some reason I thought it was help on his schoolwork, so I always went to great pains to hide my notebooks and not sit next to him in class; I wouldn&#x2019;t be used like a crib sheet. But of course that wasn&#x2019;t what he wanted; he was always good in school. He never said what he wanted, in fact, not in all the years I knew him, but you do not judge a man by what he says. You judge him by what he does, and one clear bright night in May when we walked by the strawberry patch, he held my hand all the way to Childress. That&#x2019;s all it took, just the briefest touch, in those days when I wore my nerves outside my skin like lace. Of course I lost my heart.<br>I was there with Holland in World War Two. He loved that I &#x201c;talked like a book&#x201d; and not like any of the other girls, and when the time finally came for him to go into the army, I watched him step onto that bus and head to war. It was a lonely grief for a young girl.<br>It never occurred to me that I could leave as well, not until a government man walked up to our house and asked for me by name. I tromped down in my faded sundress to find a very ruddy and clean-shaven man wearing a lapel pin of the Statue of Liberty in gold; I coveted it terribly. His name was Mr. Pinker. He was the kind of man you were supposed to obey. He talked to me about jobs in California, how industries wanted strong women like me. His words&#x2014;they were rips in a curtain, revealing a vista to a world I had never imagined before: airplanes, California; it was like agreeing to travel to another planet. After I thanked the man, he said, &#x201c;Well then, as thanks you can do a favor for me.&#x201d; To my young mind, it seemed like nothing special at all.<br>&#x201c;Now that sounds like the first bright idea you ever had,&#x201d; my father said when I mentioned leaving. I can&#x2019;t find any memory in which he held my gaze as long as he did that day. I packed my bags and never saw Kentucky again.<br>On the bus ride to California, I studied the mountains&#x2019; ascent into a line of clouds and saw where, as if set upon those clouds, even higher mountains loomed. I had never seen a sight like that in all my life. It was as if the world had been enchanted all along and no one told me.<br>As for the favor the man asked of me, it was perfectly simple: he just wanted me to write letters. About the girls around me in the shipyard and the planes and conversations I overheard, everyday rituals: what we ate, what I wore, what I saw. I laughed to think what good it would do him. Now I can only laugh at myself&#x2014;the government must have been looking for suspicious activities, but he didn&#x2019;t tell me that. He told me to pretend I was keeping a diary. I did my duty; I did it even when I left my first job to become a WAVE&#x2014;only a few other girls from a community like mine&#x2014;spreading Noxzema on our pimply faces, the girls&#x2019; rears shaking to the radio, getting used to Coke instead of rationed coffee and Chinese food instead of hamburgers. I sat there every night and tried to write it all down, but I found my own life lacking; it hardly seemed worth telling. Like so many people, I was deaf to my own stories. So I made them up.<br>My life wasn&#x2019;t interesting to me, but I&#x2019;d read books that were, and that is what I put down, with details stolen from Flaubert and Ford and Ferber, intrigues and sorrows and brief colorful joys: a beautiful work of fiction for my country held together with silence and lies. That is, it turns out, what holds a country together. I did my job well, in the handwriting my mother had taught me, tall and loyal and true, signed with the special slipknot P for Pearlie I invented at the age of nine, mailed to Mr. William Pinker, 62 Holly Street, Washington, D.C.<br>What did you do in the war, Grandma? I lied to my country, pretending to tattle on friends. I&#x2019;m sure I was just one of thousands; I&#x2019;m sure it was a clearinghouse for lonely hearts like me. Imagine the ad jingle: &#x201c;Be a finker... for Mr. Pinker!&#x201d;<br>Then the war ended, as did the factory work for women and our jobs as WAVEs. I had long since stopped writing my notes to Washington; there was so much else to worry about and I had my position doing piecework sewing to pay for meals. And one day, alone down by the ocean, I walked right by a sailor on a bench, sitting with his book facedown like a fig leaf on his lap, staring out to sea.<br>I knew very little about men, so I was startled to see such despair on his square handsome face. I knew him. The boy who&#x2019;d held my hand all the way to Childress, whose heart I had, at least briefly, possessed. Holland Cook.<br>I said hello.<br>&#x201c;Well hi there, Sarah, how&#x2019;s the dog?&#x201d; he said amiably. The wind stopped, as if, like Holland, it did not recognize me. Sarah was not my name.<br>We stayed there for a moment in the oyster-colored air, with his smile slowly sagging, my hand holding the flap of my coat to my throat, my bright kerchief tugging in the wind, and a sickness building in my stomach. I could have moved on; merely walked away so he would never know who I was. Just some strange girl fading into the fog.<br>But instead I said my name.<br>Then you recognized me, didn&#x2019;t you, Holland? Your childhood sweetheart. Pearlie who&#x2019;d read poetry to you, who&#x2019;d taken piano lessons from your mother; that was the second time we met. A sudden memory of home, opening like a pop-up book. He chatted with me, he even made me laugh a little, and when I said I had no escort to the movies that Friday and asked if he would come, he paused a while before looking at me, saying quietly, &#x201c;All right.&#x201d;<br>I was shocked when he turned up at my rooming house. The low-watt bulbs revealed a weary man, hat in his hands, his skin a little ashen, his elegant necktie loosely knotted. He claimed, years later, that he couldn&#x2019;t even remember what he or I wore that night: &#x201c;Was it the green dress?&#x201d; No, Holland; it was black roses on white; its pattern is framed and hung in my memory alongside our honeymoon wallpaper (pale green garlands). I thought he might be drunk; I was afraid he might collapse, but he smiled and offered his arm and after the film took me to a nice restaurant out in North Beach. At dinner, he hardly ate or spoke. He barely looked at me, or noticed the stares we got from other patrons; his own gaze was fixed on two cast-iron dogs that sat before the unlit fireplace. So after we had taken the streetcar to my corner, and it was time to say good night, I was surprised when he turned very quickly and kissed me on the mouth. An electric jolt of happiness passed through me. He stepped back, breathing quickly and buttoned his jacket to go. &#x201c;I have to see a friend,&#x201d; he told me sharply.<br>&#x201c;Holland,&#x201d; I said. He looked back at me as if I had jerked a string. &#x201c;Holland,&#x201d; I repeated. He waited. And then I said the right thing. It was the only time I ever did: &#x201c;Let me take care of you.&#x201d;<br>His deep eyes awakened. Did he think I meant to remind him of our time back in Kentucky, that I offered the soft threat of the past? A dark line appeared between his eyebrows.<br>He said, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know me, not really.&#x201d;<br>I told him that didn&#x2019;t matter, but what I meant was that he was wrong; I knew him, of course I knew all about him from that time in our constricting little hometown: the grass behind the schoolyard we used to poke with a stick, the path from Franklin to Childress cluttered with witch hazel and touch-me-nots and railroad vine, the ice shivering in a summer pitcher of h...</p></p><h2>The Shirley Sherwood Collection: Modern Masterpieces of Botanical Art</h2><p>This book is a celebration of the Shirley Sherwood Collection of contemporary botanical art, made over a period of 30 years by Dr Shirley Sherwood and considered the most important private collection of its kind in the world.

Showcasing the beauty and diversity of the collection, this book features 285 botanical paintings by 144 artists from 36 countries. The paintings are arranged in chapters by geographical origin of the artists, and each artwork is beautifully reproduced on a single page. Many of the artists are from the British Isles but there are also impressive and varied paintings from Japan, Thailand, Brazil, Australia, Russia, South Africa and the United States. The many ways used to create plant portraits are explored in watercolour, pen and ink, oils, diamond point etching on paper, vellum, glass and canvas. An additional chapter features the thousandth painting by Coral Guest, and how this was initiated and added to the collection. Biographies of all the artists featured are provided at the back of the book.</p><p></p><h2>Second Space: New Poems</h2><p><p>Nobel laureate Czeslaw Milosz's most recent collection <em>Second Space</em> marks a new stage in one of the great poetic pilgrimages of our time. Few poets have inhabited the land of old age as long or energetically as Milosz, for whom this territory holds both openings and closings, affirmations as well as losses. "Not soon, as late as the approach of my ninetieth year, / I felt a door opening in me and I entered / the clarity of early morning," he writes in "Late Ripeness." Elsewhere he laments the loss of his voracious vision - "My wondrously quick eyes, you saw many things, / Lands and cities, islands and oceans" - only to discover a new light that defies the limits of physical sight: "Without eyes, my gaze is fixed on one bright point, / That grows large and takes me in."</p> <p><em>Second Space</em> is typically capacious in the range of voices, forms, and subjects it embraces. It moves seamlessly from dramatic monologues to theological treatises, from philosophy and history to epigrams, elegies, and metaphysical meditations. It is unified by Milosz's ongoing quest to find the bond linking the things of this world with the order of a "second space," shaped not by necessity, but grace. <em>Second Space</em> invites us to accompany a self-proclaimed "apprentice" on this extraordinary quest. In "Treatise on Theology," Milosz calls himself "a one day's master." He is, of course, far more than this. <em>Second Space</em> reveals an artist peerless both in his capacity to confront the world's suffering and in his eagerness to embrace its joys: "Sun. And sky. And in the sky white clouds. / Only now everything cried to him: Eurydice! / How will I live without you, my consoling one! / But there was a fragrant scent of herbs, the low humming of bees, / And he fell asleep with his cheek on the sun-warmed earth."</p></p><p><p>Czeslaw Milosz was born in Szetejnie, Lithuania, in 1911. He worked with the Polish resistance movement in Warsaw during World War II and was later stationed in Paris and Washington, D.C., as a Polish cultural attach�. He defected to France in 1951, and in 1960 he accepted a position at the University of California, Berkeley. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1980, and was a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. He died in 2004.</p>The title's second space comprises heaven and hell, which have "vanished forever"; without them the blessed cannot "meet salvation" and the damned "find suitable quarters." In mourning, the poet exhorts: "Let us implore that it be returned to us,/ That second space." The Nobel laureate, who died this past summer in Krak�w at 93, is preoccupied in this collection with establishing that space through words, but also finds it in carnality and in "the unattainable Now." The opening section of summative short lyrics on themes familiar from late Milosz (memory, salvation, place) is followed by four long poems. "Father Severinus" is an eponymous 11-poem dramatic monologue of a priest (who shares one of the names of medieval philosopher Boethius) in whom there is "only a hope of hope." Next comes "Treatise on Theology" ("A young man couldn't write a treatise like this,/ Though I don't think it is dictated by fear of death"), followed by "Apprentice," a beautiful autobiography in verse (with extensive prose annotations by Milosz) and finally a stunning, short "Orpheus and Eurydice": "His lyre was silent and in his dream he was defenseless./ He knew he must have faith and he could not have faith./ And so he would persist, for a very long time,/ Counting his steps in a half-wakeful torpor." The terrors, torpors and partial redemptions of this collection feel wholly earned. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When escaped convict Craig Larson goes on a rampage that includes the murder of Riley Burke, a neighbor and business partner of former Santa Fe police chief Kerney, that's enough to bring Kerney, at least temporarily, out of retirement&#x2014;and back from London, where Kerney's wife is a U.S. embassy employee. Larson's crime spree becomes more deadly as he tacks back and forth as far south as Texas and north almost to Colorado. Kerney, acting as a special investigator with the New Mexico State Police, and his lawman son, Clayton Istee, partner up for the statewide manhunt. McGarrity is particularly adept at portraying multijurisdictional investigations. While this isn't a good starting place for newcomers, series fans will relish the deepening relationship of Kerney and Istee, who only recently learned they were father and son. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His pace was brisk, and twice he glanced over his shoulder to assure himself that the street behind him was empty. The creak of the garden gate when he opened it was a welcome sound.</p><p>Only then did he relax his grip on the handle of the attach�case he was carrying. Since leaving Eyskens&#x2019;s office he&#x2019;d been holding it tightly, and he felt the prickle of pins and needles in his fingers now as he shifted the case to his left hand and fumbled in his pocket for his house key.</p><p>Normally he would have been brought home by car, but that morning he&#x2019;d paid off the last of the household staff, including his chauffeur, a blunt Breton by the name of Dugarry. Maurice had found the farewells upsetting and the sight of the darkened house as he walked up the gravel path to the front door was a reminder of the loss suffered by all parties. Florence, their cook, and a family retainer for the better part of a quarter of a century, had clung to his hand when they&#x2019;d said goodbye. There&#x2019;d been tears in her eyes.</p><p>&#x2018;Tell Madame . . .&#x2019; She had begun to speak three or four times, but been unable to continue. &#x2018;Ah, but you&#x2019;ll be back . . .&#x2019; It was all she could say.</p><p>Maurice had pressed her hand in return. &#x2018;Of course, of course . . .&#x2019; Not knowing if it was true. Not knowing if they would ever meet again.</p><p>With a sigh he unlocked the door and switched on the lights in the hall. The emptiness around him seemed unnatural - he was used to the house being filled with people, loud with the voices of family and friends - and he regretted, not for the first time, his decision to postpone his departure, when he could have taken passage on the same ship that had carried his wife and their two sons across the Atlantic to New York a month earlier. Unwisely, deceived by the slow march of events in Europe following the occupation of Poland, he&#x2019;d chosen to remain in Paris for a little while longer, taking time to dispose of his business and to attend to the many other details, such as the leasing of his house, which had required his attention. The delay had proved costly. He had not yet wound up his affairs when the long-threatened German invasion had been launched a week earlier, and with their armoured units advancing now with giant strides across the Low Countries and - according to as yet unconfirmed reports - about to encircle the French army entrenched on the Somme, he had been forced to take emergency measures, selling off the last of his stock at rock-bottom prices and, even worse, engaging in the kind of transaction he would normally have shunned in an attempt to salvage at least a portion of these assets.</p><p>On that last day - the last for him, at any rate - the city had worn an air of exhaustion. The soft breeze with its promise of spring had expired, like the hopes of so many, and it was the stifling heat of summer that hung in the air now and seemed poised to descend on streets already starting to empty as cars made their slow exit bumper to bumper from the capital in anticipation of the threat that daily drew closer. Although government spokesmen had said that every inch of French soil would be defended, Maurice knew from other sources - from the rumours that sped from mouth to mouth - that the German panzers were already moving south from the coast. He had glimpsed military lorries drawn up in lines outside ministries, prepared to cart away files and other vital equipment. And although no refugees had yet appeared in Paris, travellers arriving from the north-east spoke of roads clogged by those trying to escape the fighting; of whole families on the move pushing handcarts loaded with their possessions. More ominously still, there were even reports that French soldiers without their arms had joined the fleeing columns.</p><p>Although his appointment with Eyskens was not until the afternoon, Maurice had gone into the city earlier and after calling at his bank had paid a final visit to what had been until recently the store that bore his family&#x2019;s name: Sobel Fre&#x2018;res. Furriers of distinction, the shop was located off the rue St Honor�, and although Maurice had relinquished the lease on the property he still had a key to the street door. Wandering about the deserted rooms, he had felt a deep sadness. It had taken his family years to build up the business - the company had been founded by his grandfather - and its loss felt like an amputation. He could think of no sight more desolate that day than the rows of empty hangers where only a few weeks before the finest furs had been on display, no sign more indicative of abandonment and flight than the thin patina of dust already starting to gather on the glass-topped counters.</p><p>Seeking an antidote to his depression, he&#x2019;d chosen to lunch for the last time at a favourite restaurant in the rue Cambon, one he had patronized regularly over the years, where his face and name were known not only to the patron and waiters but also to some of the other clients, successful businessmen like himself, with whom he was accustomed to exchanging nods. No doubt some of them had heard of his decision to leave: he thought he detected sympathy in the glances cast his way. But for the most part they seemed preoccupied with their own affairs. (How could they not be?) They were taking stock of the new reality. And while there was little they could do to alter it, Maurice had nevertheless been distressed to observe the all too familiar hint of a shrug in their manner; that lift of the shoulders so peculiar to the French, signifying acceptance of a situation, however disagreeable.</p><p>Catching sight of his own image in a gold-framed mirror on the other side of the restaurant - wryly noting the elegance of his appearance, his silvered hair barbered to a millimetre, the distinction of his dark suit, one of several he&#x2019;d had tailored in London, its sombre hue set off by a splash of red silk spilling from his breast pocket - he&#x2019;d reflected on how little he differed from these pillars of the bourgeoisie, at least on the surface. How even now, he might have been pondering his country&#x2019;s future in the light of the fate that was about to overtake it: assessing what impact occupation by a foreign power would have on himself and his family, how best to protect his interests. In all probability the course of his life had not differed much from theirs. As a youth he had run up debts and made a fool of himself over women - to the despair of his father - but later redeemed himself by volunteering to serve in the war which only a generation earlier had bled his country white, and being twice decorated for gallantry. He had married well and raised a family.</p><p>But none of that mattered any longer, he knew, none of it counted. The future lay with the jackbooted conquerors whose armoured units even now were beating a path to the city&#x2019;s gates, and they would not be deceived.</p><p>A Jew was a Jew.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Willem Eyskens&#x2019;s office, or rather his place of business, since buying and selling were very much part of his day-to-day operations, was located off the rue de Rivoli. The brass plate beside the locked door bore his name, but gave no further information. Indeed, if you were not expected there in all likelihood you were not welcome, and beyond the door, which was only opened after the caller had adequately identified himself, access was further barred by a guard, presumably armed, who sat at a table in the small entrance hall with an alarm button close at hand. Maurice had been given Eyskens&#x2019;s name by a business associate, a dealer in costume jewellery and other fashion accessories with whom he did business from time to time.</p><p>&#x2018;He&#x2019;s a diamond broker with connections in Amsterdam. Dutch originally, but he&#x2019;s been settled here a long time. He only deals in good-quality stones, I&#x2019;ve been told, and he&#x2019;s discreet. He can certainly provide what you need - at a price, of course.&#x2019;</p><p>The price, as it turned out, had been high. Eyskens had outlined the cruel economics of it at their first meeting. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s always the same in dangerous times. People try to save what they have. You can&#x2019;t take a factory with you, a business. So you turn it into something you know has value. Gold, if you can carry enough of it; otherwise stones. Diamonds. There&#x2019;s no need to explain what effect this demand has on the market.&#x2019;</p><p>A thin-faced man with red cheeks and fair hair brushed back from his forehead, Eyskens had kept his gaze on the surface of his rosewood desk while he spoke. It was as though he was embarrassed to meet Maurice&#x2019;s gaze.</p><p>&#x2018;Sufficient to say you are not the first to come to me with a request of this kind, Monsieur Sobel. These are, as I say, terrible times. Let us be businesslike. Your need is urgent, I see that. The short notice makes for difficulties, but I can provide what you want. However, I would prefer if this were a cash transaction.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You don&#x2019;t want a cheque?&#x2019; Maurice hadn&#x2019;t been altogether surprised.</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s not a matter of trust, I assure you. Your reputation is beyond question.&#x2019; Eyskens had shown small signs of discomfort. &#x2018;But I will be forced to cut corners, if I can put it like that. And later on questions may be asked - I don&#x2019;t mean by the French authorities. Paris may soon be under new rulers, men who might wish to enquire into favours done for . . . for . . .&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Jews?&#x2019; Maurice had furnished the word he was trying not to utter.</p><p>&#x2018;I am sorry . . .&#x2019; Eyskens had spread his hands on the desk.</p><p>Their first meeting had taken place the previous week, and that afternoon, having earlier withdrawn the cash from his bank - Maurice had given Eyskens a round figure to work with - he had proceeded to their final appointment. Once again he&#x2019;d been shown upstairs to the diamond broker&#x2019;s office, a small, windowless room, bare of decoration, where Eyskens was waiting. Before him on the desk was a black velvet bag tied with a drawstring. It lay on a piece of felt which had been spread across the desk. Beside the bag was a jeweller&#x2019;s loupe.</p><p>&#x2018;I will leave you now.&#x2019; Eyskens rose. &#x2018;You will want to examine the stones. Please take your time. I have made a list&#x2019; - he took a piece of paper from his jacket pocket and handed it to Maurice. &#x2018;The stones are marked by weight, but you will be able to tell by the size and the shape which is which. Taken together they match the sum we agreed on. Of course, if any of them doesn&#x2019;t meet with your approval, it can be discarded and we will make the necessary adjustment to the total.&#x2019; He bowed and left the room.</p><p>Maurice had wasted no time. Uncomfortable though the transaction made him feel, he had taken a decision and meant to stick to it. With the start of the war, the movement of funds by more orthodox means had become increasingly difficult and the German invasion had brought even those to a halt. True, in the past few months he had managed to shift a good portion of his assets abroad, but he was reluctant to leave anything he possessed to the new masters of Europe, these brutal despoilers of his people.</p><p>Emptying the velvet bag on to the felt, he had examined the glittering contents. Though no expert, his experience as a furrier had made him familiar with all aspects of the fashion trade, including its most luxurious and costly items, and a few minutes&#x2019; study with the loupe were enough to reassure him of the quality of the goods he was purchasing. The bag contained a score of diamonds - cut stones, as he&#x2019;d requested - the biggest the size of his thumbnail, all of the finest water.</p><p>By the time the broker returned ten minutes later, Maurice had emptied the attach� case, which had been resting on the floor at his feet, and laid out the stacks of banknotes he had brought in a neat pile alongside the diamonds.</p><p>&#x2018;You are satisfied, then?&#x2019; Eyskens resumed his position across the desk.</p><p>&#x2018;Perfectly.&#x2019;</p><p>Maurice was relieved that their business was over. For some reason - its hole-in-the-wall nature, perhaps - he&#x2019;d found it distasteful. Nor had he warmed to the man who sat facing him. The Dutchman&#x2019;s pale blue eyes were unreadable.</p><p>&#x2018;Would you like to count the money, Monsieur Eyskens?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Given who I am dealing with, that will not be necessary.&#x2019; The broker had accompanied these words with a polite bow. They both rose.</p><p>&#x2018;Goodbye, Monsieur Sobel. I wish you good fortune.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was nothing more he could do. Everything was set now for his departure the following morning, and as he wandered about the house switching on lights, Maurice went over the plans he&#x2019;d made, plans which had grown in complication as the situation around him became more unstable. With sailings from Le Havre suspended, he&#x2019;d been obliged to look further afield and had managed to book passage on a liner leaving Lisbon for New York in a week&#x2019;s time. This had still left him with the problem of getting to the Portuguese capital, and having considered - and discarded - the idea of trying to find a seat on the by now overcrowded trains heading south from the city daily, he had decided instead to make the long journey by motor car.</p><p>Dugarry&#x2019;s last job before departing to join his wife and children in Rennes had been to service the Sobels&#x2019; Citro�n cabriolet and to ensure that the tyres were in good condition and reserve supplies of fuel stowed aboard. Even so, Maurice might have felt daunted by the thought of the drive ahead - apart from the odd Sunday outing it was some years since he had driven a car - had it not been for a stroke of good fortune that had come his way a few days earlier. An acquaintance of his, a Polish art dealer called Kinski, long settled in France, had rung him out of the blue to ask, if it was not prying, if it was not an indelicate question, whether what he had heard was true - that Sobel was intending to quit Paris and would be travelling to Spain in his car? Before Maurice had time to get over his surprise - he had discussed his plans with only one or two people - Kinski had revealed the reason for his enquiry.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ve been asked if I can help a young man whom the Nazis would like to get their hands on. A Polish officer. Jan Belka&#x2019;s his name. He joined the resistance soon after the Germans occupied Warsaw, but unfortunately his group was betrayed and he had to get out in a hurry. He&#x2019;s been in Paris for some time, without papers, of course, and now he&#x2019;s in danger again. He&#x2019;d like to get to London, but Spain would be a start. I was wondering . . . would it be possible . . . ?&#x2019;</p><p>While Kinski was speaking, Maurice had had time to reflect on the fact that it was not so surprising after all that his help should have been sought in the matter. The Sobels were Polish by extraction. They made no secret of it.</p><p>&#x2018;You want me to take this man with me?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;If possible. And his companion, a young woman, also Polish.&#x2019; Kinski had hesitated. He said delicately, &#x2018;I understand she is Jewish.&#x2019;</p><p>Ignoring the momentary prick of anger he felt just then - as if the fact that the girl was Jewish might sway him, as if he might be less in...</p></p><h2>Eve and Adam: Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Readings on Genesis and Gender</h2><p><p>The editors have performed a great service in making widely available a documentary history of the interpretation of the Eve and Adam story." &#x2015;Publishers Weekly</p><p>This fascinating volume examines Genesis 1-3 and the different ways that Jewish, Christian, and Muslim interpreters have used these passages to define and enforce gender roles.... a 'must'...

This remarkable anthology surveys more than 2,000 years of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim commentary and debate on the biblical story that continues to raise fundamental questions about what it means to be a man or to be a woman. The selections range widely from early postbiblical interpretations in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha to the Qur&#x2019;an, from Thomas Aquinas to medieval Jewish commentaries, from Christian texts to 19th-century antebellum slavery writings, and on to pieces written especially for this volume.</p></p><p><p>KRISTEN E.

ZIEGLER is a professor in the department of Religious Studies at DePauw University in Greencastle, IN. She is author of The Advocates of Peace in Antebellum America.</p>In western culture and religion, the Genesis story of Eve and Adam has established and dominated views about gender roles. A long history of interpretation of Genesis 1-3 exists in all three of the great monotheistic religions. In this anthology, the editors have gathered primary documents from each of these traditions to examine this history of interpretation. Each section contains a brief historical essay that sets the readings in context, and the editors briefly introduce the individual writings. Chapter 1 offers selections from Genesis 1-5. Chapter 2 provides documents of Jewish post-biblical interpretation, including apocryphal texts like Sirach and pseudepigraphical texts like the Life of Adam and Eve. Chapter 3 contains rabbinic interpretations of Genesis 1-3, including midrashim like the one attributed to Rabbi Joshua ben Karhah: "It teaches you through what sin that wicked creature inveigled them, because he saw them engaged in their natural function, he [the serpent] conceived a passion for her." Chapter 4 contains early Christian interpretations ranging from biblical texts (1 Corinthians 15:21-22) to the theological writings of Tertullian and Augustine. Chapter 5 collects readings of the story from the Middle Ages, including various readings from the Qur'an and commentaries by Islamic theologians. The writings of Martin Luther and other Protestant reformers on Eve and the role of woman are gathered in Chapter 6. The writings in Chapter 7 demonstrate the ways that various 19th-century American social movements, like abolition and women's suffrage, and new religious groups, like the Shakers and the Christian Scientists, interpreted the Genesis story. The final chapter includes writings from 20th-century Christians, Jews and Muslims demonstrating that the debate about the meanings of Genesis 1-3 is far from over. The editors have performed a great service in making widely available a documentary history of the interpretation of the Eve and Adam story. <p></p><p>Copyright 1999 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist&#39;s Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan</h2><p>Until his death in 2000, Artyom Borovik was considered one of the preeminent journalists in Russia. With <i>The Hidden War</i> he provided the world its first glimpse inside the Soviet military machine, capturing the soldiers' terror, helplessness, and despair at waging war in a foreign land against an unseen enemy for unclear purposes. When first published, Borovik's groundbreaking revelations exposed the weaknesses beneath the Soviet Union's aura of military might, creating an enormous controversy both in Russia and around the world. A vital and fascinating portrait of the Soviet empire at the twilight of its power, this is a book that still resonates today. "An honest and graphic account of individual and general disillusionment during the very worst kind of war." -Christopher Hitchens, New York Newsday; "Alternately fascinating and horrific.... A fascinating look at the life and death of Soviet soldiers." -- Bill Wallace, San Francisco Chronicle; "I have read no other account of the war in Afghanistan equal to this ... this is literature." -- Graham Greene</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: RussianBorovik, foreign editor of the Soviet weekly Ogonyok , spent a month with Soviet troops in Afghanistan near the end of the 1979-1988 war. His subjective, impressionistic account is of interest mainly for its startling echoes of the American experience in Vietnam: The Soviet soldiers' awed respect for the elusive enemy, their disgust over the waste of lives, their resentment of the harassment accorded returning veterans by an antiwar populace. And like our GIs in Vietnam, these men found solace in rock music, odd garb and drugs. The pathology of the Vietnam war is mirrored also with stories of Soviet atrocities: rape, murder and a My Lai-like massacre of civilians. Borovik summarizes the prevalent theories as to why the Soviets intervened in '79. The most interesting: Moscow's fear that the U.S., expelled from Iran, would attempt to turn Afghanistan into an anti-Soviet outpost. Although in its raw candor the book stands as a manifestation of glasnost , the writing is uneven, often jarring: "Oh, how harsh is my fate!" cries one veteran. Photos.

With his other 'shorter' collections Black + Blues and Third World Poems, MiddlePassages creates a kind of chisel which may well lead us into a projected third trilogy. Here is a political angle to Brathwaite's Caribbean &amp; New World quest, with new notes of protest and lament. It marks a Sisyphean stage of Third World history in which things fall apart and everyone's achievements come tumbling back down upon their heads and into their hearts, like the great stone which King Sisyphus was condemned to keep heaving back up the same hill in hell - a postmodernist implosion already signalled by Baldwin, Patterson, Soyinka and Achebe and more negatively by V.S. Naipaul; but given a new dimension here by Brathwaite's rhythmical and 'video' affirmations. And so MiddlePassages includes poems for those modern heroes who are the pegs by which the mountain must be climbed again: Maroon resistance, the poets Nicolas Guillen, the Cuban revolutionary, and Mikey Smith, stoned to death on Stony Hill; the great musicians (Ellington, Bessie Smith); and Third World leaders Kwame Nkrumah, Walter Rodney and Nelson Mandela.</p><p>This book addresses the effects of the middle passage of slavery on the New world, and celebrate great musicians, poets, heroes, of the resistance, and Third World leaders.Kamau Brathwaite was born in Barbados in 1930. Co-founder of the Caribbean Artists Movement, Brathwaite has received numerous awards, including the Neustadt International Prize for Literature, and the Casa de las Americas Prize.

She describes three ways of approaching Glastonbury: by way of the legends associated with it (including early folklore, Joseph of Arimathea, the Grail, and King Arthur); through the known history of the area and its great, but never dominating influence on the history of England; and finally, through the mystical path. It is this true vision of the mystical way, encompassing all aspects of the area, both seen and unseen, which reveals Glastonbury as the Avalon of the Heart.<p>Fortune first visited Glastonbury while Bligh Bond was still uncovering its past with his psychic investigations into the Abbey ruins. It was also there that she received her first major and dramatic Inner Plane contact in Chalice Orchard, close to Chalice Well.

Addressing children&#x2019;s classics as well as the Disney affiliates&#x2019; more recent attempts to capture adult audiences, the contributors respond to the Disney film legacy from feminist, marxist, poststructuralist, and cultural studies perspectives. The volume contemplates Disney&#x2019;s duality as an American icon and as an industry of cultural production, created in and through fifty years of filmmaking. The contributors treat a range of topics at issue in contemporary cultural studies: the performance of gender, race, and class; the engendered images of science, nature, technology, family, and business. The compilation of voices in From Mouse to Mermaid creates a persuasive cultural critique of Disney&#x2019;s ideology.</p><p>The contributors are Bryan Attebery, Elizabeth Bell, Claudia Card, Chris Cuomo, Ramona Fernandez, Henry A.

Q without U? Mpssh! you say. Yet once, long ago, P's and Q's minded their p's and q's, and though U and I deserved not one iota of respect.

The uneasy truce between the aristocratic vowels and the plebian consonants finally breaks down into open warfare, but at the advent of a giant scribble (oxymoronically described as ``zigs and zags with no form at all''), they join together to ``STOP'' the monster and bid it ``GO AWAY.'' `` `I can't fight that,' whimpered the jumble. `Next they'll make paragraphs . . . pages . . . chapters. . . ' '' Sprouting stick limbs and large hats, the letters, uppercase if adult, lowercase when young, swarm antlike across cleanly drawn backdrops. ``Just think what we can accomplish together,'' enthuses the Supreme Command to the Commander in Chief. ``The poems! The plays! Our memoirs!'' Actually, even careless readers will notice that both sides have been using each other right along in speech, an evidently unintended paradox. Next to books like Eve Merriam's Fighting Words (1992) or Bill Martin and John Archambault's Chicka Chicka Boom Boom (1989), the language play here seems clumsy.

The unacceptable legacy of statin drug use at today&#39;s high doses is a trail of chronic aches and pains, numbness, weakness, confusion, fatigue, shortness of breath and even heart failure in hordes of unsuspecting victims. Only by knowing this information, and in consultation with your healthcare professional, can you make an informed decision about your health care. If you are a user of Vytorin, Lipitor, Zocor, Crestor, Mevacor, Pravachol or Lescol you must read this book. Most of the statin side effects I discuss are unknown to your busy doctor. Although knowledgeable about muscle and liver problems, few have heard of statin amnesia and other forms of memory dysfunction and fewer still associate hostility, aggression and profound depression as statin related. As a former astronaut, aerospace medical research scientist, flight surgeon and family doctor, I was appalled by the lack of information in the medical community on the full range of side effects of the statin drugs.

Men in loincloths and women in saris had begun to dance barefoot, kicking up dust. Smoke curled from cooking fires and tobacco. The drums, the monotonous twanging of a stringed instrument, and loud singing obliterated the sounds of the forest.<br> <br>A man with a thin, frown-creviced face topped by dark hair combed back from his high forehead sat as still as a stone image in their midst, in a chair that still had its arms but had lost its backrest. His long nose struck out, arrow-like, beneath deep-set eyes. He had smoked a pipe all evening and held one polite leaf cup of toddy that he had only pretended to sip. His kurta and dhoti were an austere white, his waistcoat a lawyerly black.<br> <br>He did not appear to hear the singing. But his eyes were on the dancers: wasn&#x2019;t that girl in the red sari the one who had come with baskets of wild hibiscus that she had flung carelessly into a corner of his factory floor? And that man who was dancing with his arm around her waist, wasn&#x2019;t he one of the honey-collectors? It was hard to tell, with their new saris and dhotis, the flowers in their hair, the beads flying out from necks, the firelight. The man leaned forward, trying to tell which of the sweat-gleaming faces he had encountered before in his small workforce.<br> <br>The brown-suited, toadlike figure sitting on a stool next to him nudged him in the ribs. &#x201c;Something about these tribal girls, eh, Amulya Babu? Makes long-married men think unholy thoughts! And do you know, they&#x2019;ll sleep with any number of men they like!&#x201d; He emptied his cup of toddy into his mouth and licked his lips, saying, &#x201c;Strong stuff! I should sell it in my shop!&#x201d;<br> <br>A bare-chested villager refilled the cup, saying, &#x201c;Come and dance with us, Cowasjee Sahib! And Amulya Babu, you are not drinking at all! This is the first time people from outside the jungle have come as guests to our harvest festival. And because <i>I insisted</i>. I said, it&#x2019;s Cowasjee Sahib and Amulya Babu who give us our roti and salt! We must repay them in our humble way!&#x201d;<br> <br>A tall, hard-muscled man stood nearby, listening, lips curling with contempt as his relative hovered over the four or five friends Cowasjee had brought with him, radiating obeisance as he refilled their cups. Beyond the pool of firelight, cooking smells, and noise, the forest darkened into shadows. Somewhere, a buffalo let out a mournful, strangled bellow. The drums gathered pace, the girls linked their arms behind each other&#x2019;s waists, swaying to the rhythm, and the men began to sing:<br> <br><i>A young girl with a waist so slender that</i><br> <br><i>I can put my finger around it,</i><br> <br><i>Is going down to the well for water.</i><br> <br><i>With swaying hips she goes.</i><br> <br><i>My life yearns with desire.</i><br> <br><i>My bed is painted red.</i><br> <br><i>Red are my blankets.</i><br> <br><i>For these four months of rain and happiness</i><br> <br><i>Stay, stay with me.</i><br> <br><i>Without you I cannot eat,</i><br> <br><i>Without you I cannot drink.</i><br> <br><i>I&#x2019;ll find no joy in anything.</i><br> <br><i>So stay, stay, for the months of rain,</i><br> <br><i>And for happiness with me.</i><br> <br>One of the girls in the line of dancers separated herself from her partners. She had noticed Amulya&#x2019;s preoccupied expression, wondered how a man could remain unmoved by the music, not drink their wine. She came forward with a smile, her beads and bangles jingling, her bare shoulders gleaming in the firelight, orange sari wrapped tight over her young body. The toddy made her head spin a little when she bent down to Amulya. As he tried to scramble away, she stroked his cheek and said, &#x201c;Poor babuji, are you too pining for someone?&#x201d; She leaned closer and whispered into his ear, &#x201c;Won&#x2019;t you come and dance? It wipes sorrows away.&#x201d;<br> <br>Amulya looked up beyond her childish face, framed by curling hair which smelled of a strong, sweet oil, at the flamboyant purple flower pinned into her bun. It had a ring of lighter petals within the purple ones, and a pincushion of stamens. <i>Passiflora</i>, of course. Yes, certainly <i>Passiflora</i>. But what species?<br> <br>Despite the haze of alcohol that made her eyes slide from thing to thing, the girl noticed that the man&#x2019;s gaze was not on her face, but on the flower. She unpinned it and held it out to him. A deep dimple pierced her cheek. The drums rolled again, a fresh song started, and she tripped back to her friends with a laugh, looking once over her shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Amulya Babu, the girl likes you!&#x201d; Cowasjee cried, slapping Amulya&#x2019;s thigh. &#x201c;You can turn down food and drink, but how can you turn down a lusting woman? Go on, dance with her! That&#x2019;s the done thing in these parts!&#x201d;<br> <br>Amulya stood up from his chair and moved away from Cowasjee&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;I have to leave now,&#x201d; he said, his tone peremptory. In his left hand he clutched the purple flower. With the other he felt about for his umbrella.<br> <br>Amulya understood he was an anomaly. When still new in the town adjoining the jungle, he had tried to make himself part of local society by going to a few parties. Songarh&#x2019;s local rich, they too had hopes of him, as a metropolitan dandy perhaps, laden with tales and gossip from the big city, conversant with its fashions, bright with repartee, a tonic for their jaded, small-town appetites. He had had many eager invitations.<br> <br>After the first few parties, at which he refused offers of whisky and pink gins, and then waited, not talking very much, for dinner to be served and the evening to end, he had realised that perhaps his being there was not serving any purpose. Was he really becoming a bona fide local by attending these parties when his presence emanated obligation?<br> <br>Today &#x2013; these festivities at the village whose people were his workforce &#x2013; he had thought it would be different. He had, for a change, wanted to come. He had only ever seen tribal people at work &#x2013; what were they like at play, what were their homes like? The opportunity had seemed too good to miss; but Cowasjee, in whom the bare-shouldered village girls seemed to unleash more than his usual loutishness, had ensured that this evening was like all the others.<br> <br>Amulya looked around for someone to thank, but everywhere people sat on their haunches drinking, or they danced, enclosed in worlds of private rapture. The drums had speeded up, the twanging could scarcely keep pace. Where was his umbrella? And his office bag? Was his tonga waiting for him as instructed? Was anyone sober enough to light his way to the tonga?<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh sit, sit, Amulya Babu,&#x201d; Cowasjee said, tugging Amulya&#x2019;s sleeve. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t go without eating, they&#x2019;ll be sure their food was too humble for you, they&#x2019;ll feel insulted. The night is young and we have stories to swap! Have you heard this one?&#x201d; Cowasjee cackled in anticipation of his punchline.<br> <br>Amulya sat again, annoyed and reluctant, barely able to summon up a strained smile to the yodelled laughs that accompanied the ensuing discussion about why a woman&#x2019;s two holes smelled different despite being geographically proximate. &#x201c;Just like the difference between Darjeeling tea and Assam!&#x201d; one of Cowasjee&#x2019;s friends shrieked. &#x201c;Both in the hills of eastern India, but their aromas worlds apart!&#x201d; The third said, &#x201c;You bugger! More like the difference between the stink of a sewage nullah and a water drain!&#x201d; They nudged each other and pointed at the girls dancing by the fire. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s for you,&#x201d; giggled one. &#x201c;How &#x2019;bout taking her home and confirming the Assam&#x2013;Darjeeling hypothesis?&#x201d;<br> <br>The tall, muscular villager stepped out from the shadows, one fist clenched around a long bamboo pole. In two rapid strides, he and his weapon were towering over them. Cowasjee shrank back on his stool. The obsequious middleman noticed the threat and scurried out from a corner. He said something over his shoulder to the drummer, then to a woman tending a cooking pot. The drums fell suddenly quiet. Confused, the dancers stopped mid-stride. The woman called out, &#x201c;We will eat now, before the chickens run out from the rice!&#x201d;<br> <br>The stringed instrument played on, its performer too rapt to pause. The man with the bamboo pole stepped aside, not taking his expressionless eyes off Cowasjee.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Far away, Kananbala heard the faint sound of drums, like a pulse in the night. Another night of waiting. At nine-thirty the neighbour&#x2019;s car. Slamming doors. Shouts to the watchman. Ten. The whir of the clock gathering its energies for the long spell of gongs to come. The creaking of trees. A single crow, confused by moonlight. The wind banging a door. Ten-thirty. The owls calling, one to the other, the foxes further away. Then the faint clop of hooves. Closer, the clop of hooves together now with the sound of wheels on tarmac, whip on hide. A tongawallah cursing. Amulya saying, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it, no further.&#x201d; His voice too loud.<br> <br>Kananbala dropped her age-softened copy of the Ramayana and went to the window. She could see her husband hunching to release himself from the shelter of the tonga, too tall for its low bonnet. She turned away and returned to the bed, picking up her Ramayana again. When Amulya entered the room and looked around for his slippers, she did not tell him she had put them under the table. When he asked her, &#x201c;Have you eaten?&#x201d; she pretended to be immersed in her book. When he said, &#x201c;Are the children asleep?&#x201d; she replied, &#x201c;Of course. It&#x2019;s so late.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They only served dinner at ten. They wouldn&#x2019;t let me leave without eating, what do you expect me to do?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; Kananbala said, &#x201c;I know ...&#x201d; Something caught her eye and she stopped.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What? That? Oh, it&#x2019;s a flower.&#x201d;<br> <br>Amulya&#x2019;s voice was muffled beneath the kurta he was pulling off over his head. She could see his vest, striped with ribs, his stomach arcing in. She looked again at the flower, dark purple, wilted. He had placed it under the lamp near the bed. In the light of the lamp she could see one long, black strand of hair stuck to the gummy edge of its stem.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s a flower,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Why have you brought it home?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just wanted to identify it ... &#x201c; he said, leaving the room.<br> <br>She had often asked him before: were there women at the parties he went to? The host&#x2019;s wife? Her friends or relatives? Why could she, Kananbala, never be taken? He always laughed with condescension or said, exasperated, &#x201c;I have never met women at these parties, neither do I aspire to.&#x201d; And what of today, the festival at the tribal village &#x2013; could she not have been taken? If she were a tribal woman herself, she would have needed no man&#x2019;s permission.<br> <br>Amulya returned to their room with a large, hard-covered book. He sat near the lamp and opened it, then put on his black-framed spectacles. He picked up the flower in one hand, turned the pages of the book with the other, looking once at the pages and once at the flower, saying under his breath, &#x201c;<i>Passiflora</i> of course, but <i>incarnata</i>? I&#x2019;ve never seen <i>this</i> vine in Songarh.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kananbala turned away, lay back against her pillow and shut her eyes. She could hear pages rustling, Amulya murmuring under his breath. She wished with a sudden flaming urge that she could stamp on his spectacles and smash them.<br> <br>Amulya laid the flower against an illustration in the book and whispered, &#x201c;<i>Incarnata</i>, yes, it is <i>incarnata</i>. Roxburgh has to be right.&#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>In about 1907 , when Amulya moved from Calcutta to Songarh, he could still see the town had been hacked out, maybe a hundred years before, from forest and stone. The town perched on a rocky plateau, at the edge of which he could see, even from the house, a dark strip of forest and the irregular, bluish shadows of the hills beyond. In the distance were broken-down walls of medieval stone &#x2013; the ruined fort, the <i>garh</i> from which the town took its name. A few walls and one domed watchtower, enough to fuel Amulya&#x2019;s fantasies, could still be discerned in the ruins. In front there was a shallow pool with inlaid stone patterns around its edges. Beyond the fort lay an ancient, dried stream-bed that separated it from the forest and hilly mounds. It was said that an entire city would some day be found buried around the fort. Some claimed Songarh had been one of the centres of Buddhist learning in the ancient past and that the Buddha himself had rested there, under a tree, on one of his journeys. On his first visit to the fort, Amulya saw that there was indeed an ancient, spreading banyan tree with its own jungle of stone-coloured aerial roots. The tree had a knot on its main trunk that in a certain light looked like the face of a meditating man.<br> <br>When Amulya brought his family to Songarh, it was no longer a centre of learning, but it had acquired new importance after the discovery by the imperial geologists of ores of mica. There was even more lucrative material below the forests somewhat further away: coal. Among the patchy fields of millet and greens there grew a tiny British colony of people who supervised the coal mines and the nearer mica ores from the salubrious climate of Songarh, which was chilly enough in winter for log fires. Before long the town had a white area near the fort where the handful of miners lived, forming a compact society of their own.<br> <br>Over time, Songarh acquired a main street with a few shops. One of the earliest, Finlays, was run by an enterprising Parsi who supplied the needs of the expatriates for the exotic: coffee, fruit, fish in tins, lace and lingerie, treacle and suet, cigarettes and cheese. Indians went to the shop for fabrics and buttons, medicines and cosmetics, and returned with tins of peach halves, wondering what to do with them.<br> <br>The forest watched. It was well known that leopards wandered its unknown interior. There were stories of tigers and jackals drinking together from streams that ran through it over round, grey and brown pebbles. Cows and goats disappeared, and sometimes dogs. It was useless looking for their remains. Until the mines came, and with them the safety of numbers, nobody from the town was foolhardy enough to venture into the wilderness at the edge of their homes: green, dark, alien, stretching for miles, ending only where the coal mines began.<br> <br>The forest was still the domain of tribal people with skin as shiny and dark as wet stone and straight, wiry bodies. Flowers with frilly petals nestled in the black hair of the women. They were poor; many looked as though they were starving. Yet they kept to the forest, venturing out only occasionally, in groups. Some were forced into the town when the mines gouged out chunks of their forest. They lived in makeshift shanties, working at whatever they could find. Amulya employed many of them.<br> <br>He had heard of Songarh in Calcutta, come on a visit, walked all over the little town and its surrounding countryside, and the knowledge that he would live there came to him like a benediction. Just as some people speak to you immediately without saying a word, and you feel a kinship as real as the touch of a hand, Amulya felt a connection with Songarh. He knew that if he turned away from it then, he would never be able to stop thinking of it, that all his life would feel as though it were being spent away from its core.<br> <br>In Songarh, among people whose language he did not speak, he set up his small factory to manufacture medicines an...</p><h2>Town Is by the Sea</h2><p>A young boy wakes up to the sound of the sea, visits his grandfather's grave after lunch and comes home to a simple family dinner, but all the while his mind strays to his father digging for coal deep down under the sea.

Accompanied by his wife, their cat, and an actor friend, our autobiographical narrator Ferdinand leaves Paris for Baden-Baden (a World War II hideaway for wealthy Germans), is then sent to a bombed-out Berlin, and finally leaves for Denmark in search of the gold he had stashed there prior to the war. With the Third Reich in ruins and the Allied armies on Ferdinand&#39;s heels, North combines documentary realism with hallucinatory images, capturing the chaos of war and its toll on both victim and victimizer.Louis-Ferdinand Celine (1894-1961) was a French writer and doctor whose novels are antiheroic visions of human suffering. Accused of collaboration with the Nazis, Celine fled France in 1944 first to Germany and then to Denmark. Condemned by default (1950) in France to one year of imprisonment and declared a national disgrace, Celine returned to France after his pardon in 1951, where he continued to write until his death. His classic books include Journey to the End of the Night, Death on the Installment Plan, London Bridge, North, Rigadoon, Conversations with Professor Y, Castle to Castle, and Normance.<br><br>Ralph Manheim (b.

The Pen/Ralph Manheim Medal for translation, inaugurated in his name, is a major lifetime achievement award in the field of translation. He himself won its predecessor, the PEN translation prize, in 1964. Manheim died in Cambridge in 1992.

Tassajara, the oldest Zen Buddhist monastery in the United States, was at particular risk. Set deep in the Ventana wilderness north of Big Sur, the center is connected to the outside world by a single unpaved road. If fire entered the canyon, there would be no way out.<br><br>Disaster struck during the summer months, when Tassajara opens its doors to visitors, and the grounds fill with guests expecting a restful respite. Instead, the mountain air filled with smoke, and monks broke from regular meditation to conduct fire drills. All visitors were evacuated, and many Zen students followed. A small crew of residents and firefighters remained, preparing to defend Tassajara. But nothing could have prepared them for what came next. When a treacherous shift in weather conditions brought danger nearer still, firefighters made the flash decision to completely evacuate the monastery. As the firefighters and remaining residents caravanned out the long road to Tassajara, five monks turned back, risking their lives to save the monastery. <i>Fire Monks</i> is their story.<br><br>A gripping narrative as well as an insider&#x2019;s portrait of the Zen path, <i>Fire Monks </i>reveals what it means to meet an emergency with presence of mind.

Having led change successfully at three monumental organizations&#x2014;the CIA, Texas A&amp;M University, and the Department of Defense&#x2014;he offers us the ultimate insider&#x2019;s look at how major bureaus, organizations, and companies can be transformed, which is by turns heartening and inspiring and always instructive. <br><br> With practical, nuanced advice on tailoring reform to the operative culture (we see how Gates worked within the system to increase diversity at Texas A&amp;M); effecting change within committees; engaging the power of compromise (&#x201c;In the real world of bureaucratic institutions, you almost never get all you want when you want it&#x201d;); and listening and responding to your team, Gates brings the full weight of his wisdom, candor, and devotion to civic duty to inspire others to lead desperately needed change.</p><p><b>ROBERT M.

Yet in twenty-first-century America, apart from a handful of hermits and survivalists living off the grid, dealing with impen�etrable, impersonal, infinitely complex, obdurate, arrogant, and often stupefyingly incompetent bureaucracies is an everyday travail for everyone. Think about it: Social Security. Medicare. Local, state, and federal taxing agencies. Getting a driver&#x2019;s license. Obtaining documents for business, remodeling your house, or getting a building permit. Any federal department or agency. Dealing with the phone company, your credit card issuer, a credit bureau, a billing error by a big chain store. Navigating airport security, health-care insurance, university and public school administrations.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hardly a day passes in the life of any American without his or her having to confront one or another bureaucracy, standing in line, dialing a telephone number, only to enter an automated laby�rinth seemingly devoid of humans and humanity, being placed on indefinite hold, trying to access a bad government or business Web site, or being shuffled from one office to the next to find that one person, the anomaly, who can fix a problem. Encounters with a bureaucracy almost always have stress and frustration as by-products. And finding someone in a bureaucracy who is pleas�ant <i>and </i>can solve one&#x2019;s problem quickly is so unusual as to be very nearly a life-altering experience. President Lyndon Johnson once said, &#x201c;If the first person who answers the phone cannot answer your question, it is a bureaucracy.&#x201d; Don&#x2019;t we all know it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Despite political paralysis in Washington and elsewhere, bureaucracies inexorably&#x2014;day by day, year by year&#x2014;intrude ever more pervasively into our daily lives. They influence our health, our safety, our economic well-being, our children, what we eat, what we drive, and every business, farm, and educational institu�tion in the land.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet even as bureaucratic tentacles extend their reach into every nook and cranny of America, the litany of their incompetence and arrogance grows exponentially. Many of these institutions are now indispensable, but their repeated and highly publicized sins of omission and commission have shaken the public&#x2019;s con�fidence that they&#x2014;that government in particular&#x2014;can do <i>any�thing </i>right. Just a sampling of lapses and failures in recent years regardless of who was minding the store in Congress or the White House is profoundly disturbing: 9/11 itself, a failure of intelli�gence and law enforcement of monumental consequence; the failure of virtually all our financial regulatory and administra�tive bodies to anticipate and prevent the abuses that led to the financial meltdown in 2008&#x2013;9; the Federal Emergency Manage�ment Agency&#x2019;s handling of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and other disasters; the lack of planning for post-invasion Iraq in 2003; the scandalous treatment of outpatient wounded war�riors at Walter Reed Army Medical Center; the multiple failures of the Veterans Affairs Department; challenges to the integrity of the Internal Revenue Service; lapses and scandals of the Secret Service; the initial handling of the Ebola crisis by the Centers for Disease Control; the botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare); the ever-changing and inconsistent rules relating to airport security; the extraordinary waste of development dol�lars in Iraq and Afghanistan; underperforming public schools; the inability to control our southern border; and so much more. The institutions&#x2014;the bureaucracies&#x2014;responsible for these disas�ters and embarrassments are crucial to us. Some of them have previously been among our most respected organizations. Now they are failing us.<br> &nbsp;<br> One of my favorite sayings about government&#x2014;attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte, of all people&#x2014;is &#x201c;Never mistake for malice that which is easily explained by stupidity or incompetence.&#x201d; No one set out to make bureaucracies the enemy of ordinary people, resistant to change, impervious to new realities, and incompetent. Few if any individuals choose public service as a career because they want to make life miserable for people or to work for some hapless bureaucracy. Indeed, I can attest from decades of working with talented and dedicated public servants, the opposite is often true. And yet the humorist Will Rogers could say decades ago, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t make jokes. I just watch the government and report the facts.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The world of business&#x2014;the private sector&#x2014;as I have observed it both as a customer and from the corporate boardroom has its own issues with bureaucracy. While the obstacles to cutting costs and becoming more efficient are more onerous for the public sector&#x2014;local, state, and federal&#x2014;leaders in both the public and the private sectors face multiple barriers to innovation and reform to cope with new and changing circumstances. For example, lead�ers in both sectors often encounter entrenched cultures that make real change difficult, as well as lower-level organizations resistant to guidance from the top, determined to preserve their piece of the cake and their status. Trimming organizational deadwood can be as challenging in the business world as in public institu�tions. It is a rare soul who has not been frustrated and maddened by multiple business bureaucracies&#x2014;not to mention disastrous business decisions that cost jobs and create economic turmoil and heartache.<br> &nbsp;<br> But for most businesses, success and self-preservation require that leaders and employees work hard every day to innovate and change with (or before) the times, to overcome sluggishness, poor customer service, and the stifling effect of layer upon layer of man�agement that inevitably delays and complicates decision making. As a rule, companies that do not promote innovation, strive to reduce overhead costs and managerial layering, and become more customer-friendly don&#x2019;t do well in the long term.<br> &nbsp;<br> The public sector, however, faces multiple unique obstacles to reform, whether it&#x2019;s cutting costs, becoming more efficient, encouraging innovation, or changing to cope with new challenges or changed circumstances. And no matter how different in pur�pose or size, for nearly all public bureaucracies those obstacles are the same.<br> &nbsp;<br> The everyday experiences of Americans make a compelling case that bureaucracies do not work and cannot be reformed, that we are stuck. After so many highly visible failures, public opinion polls show that, as I&#x2019;ve said, a majority of our citizens have lost confidence in our institutions and in government itself. The political Left is too often indifferent to obvious bureaucratic incompetence and failure because it believes that whatever the problem, government is the solution. It&#x2019;s tough making the case for more government when what we have works so poorly. The political Right welcomes bureaucratic incompetence as proof that government rarely does anything well, and thus it reinforces its belief that whatever the problem, government involvement will probably only make things worse.<br> &nbsp;<br> We can&#x2014;and will&#x2014;continue to argue endlessly about the proper role of government in the United States, but the fact is we have a bunch of it and most of it doesn&#x2019;t work very well. Because we actually do need government, failure to fix it imposes huge financial costs in terms of incompetence, time wasted, and inef�ficiency, not to mention the cost in public cynicism and the loss of credibility of both government and those who lead it.<br> &nbsp;<br> In truth, virtually every bureaucracy needs to reform: to mod�ernize, get rid of paralyzing procedural and operational barnacles that have accumulated over decades, reduce waste, and become more efficient and effective. When in 2010 we could find $180 bil�lion to cut (over a several-year period) in bureaucratic overhead in the Pentagon in just a few months, you have some idea of the &#x201c;opportunity&#x201d; offered by far-reaching reform. Defense is far from alone in this regard.<br> &nbsp;<br> I believe bureaucracies can be fixed: changed, made more cost-effective, user-friendly, efficient and responsive, and shaped to meet new problems and challenges even in an age of austerity. I know because, with the help of some great colleagues, I did it at three very different institutions I led&#x2014;the Central Intelligence Agency and the other dozen or so U.S. intelligence agencies; Texas A&amp;M University, now the nation&#x2019;s fifth biggest; and the Depart�ment of Defense, the largest and most complex organization on the planet. All three, and virtually all other public institutions, have similar challenges to change and reform. And my colleagues and I at all three places showed that a dysfunctional political envi�ronment is not, in itself, an overriding impediment to bureaucratic reform.<br> &nbsp;<br> You may fairly ask what three apparently unique organizations&#x2014;the CIA, A&amp;M, and Defense&#x2014;have in common and what lessons they offer for leaders at all levels of government and in business as well. Let me suggest just a few examples. While every�thing I did at the CIA was supposedly secret, everything at the university was public, and Defense was a mix, in reality I had no secrets from any of my overseers&#x2014;the White House, the gover�nor&#x2019;s mansion, Congress, the state capitol. And between aggressive media and leaks, I had few secrets from the public either. I had to do much of my business at all three in the public eye. This feature is common to virtually all public-sector bureaucracies. The influ�ence of elected officials on Pentagon programs and funding was far more prevalent and political than at either the CIA or A&amp;M, but even at the latter two every dollar the institution spent had to be approved by elected officials, who were not shy about making clear their priorities and preferences. The role of politicians in the everyday life of any public organization is significant; it&#x2019;s just that their influence is applied differently depending upon the agency or department.<br> &nbsp;<br> Also, at the CIA and Defense I supposedly could tell people what to do, whereas persuasion was my only recourse at A&amp;M. However, while I could give orders at the CIA and the Pentagon, no successful leader of either ever did so; on the big issues, like the budget, the list is long of directors and secretaries whose ambi�tious plans crashed and burned because they failed to consult and persuade the intelligence professionals and the uniformed mili�tary to go along with their plans. In sum, when it comes to the fundamentals, these three organizations have much in common.<br> &nbsp;<br> Similar traits can be found in most other institutions. I entered government nearly fifty years ago and, working for eight presi�dents, had the opportunity to observe the federal government at close hand&#x2014;including many departments and agencies not asso�ciated with national security. As president of Texas A&amp;M, I had a ringside seat to watch how state government and bureaucracies operate. And over the last twenty years, I have served on the board of directors of ten companies, where I had ample opportunity to observe the challenges of bureaucratic bloat, turf protection, empire building, and resistance to change facing their CEOs. And now I am national president of the Boy Scouts of America, which, like any big, century-old organization, has its own bureaucratic problems. Despite vastly different roles and missions, all these institutions have characteristics&#x2014;and challenges&#x2014;in common.<br> &nbsp;<br> Few leaders will ever run the CIA, the U.S. military, or a huge university (or, fortunately for most, deal with Congress). Even so, I will make clear in these pages how the lessons I learned in those institutions are broadly applicable for, and useful to, leaders in nearly all bureaucracies. In external appearance, people are infi�nitely diverse, yet beneath the skin our anatomy and the way the body works are pretty much the same. So it is with bureaucra�cies. Each shares a lot of DNA with its kin, even distant cous�ins. You will see that despite the vast variety of bureaucracies in both the public and the private sectors, their cultures, organiza�tional structures, and both internal and outside influences on their operations and behavior are remarkably similar. And thus the strategies and techniques for changing them&#x2014;reforming them&#x2014;are remarkably similar.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the pages to come, I will dwell often on my experiences in government. Mainly, that is a manifestation of my belief that they offer considerable insight into what works well or badly. Partly, though, I hope that recounting those experiences will provide&#x2014;as a bonus, if you will&#x2014;information about our government that is worth the reader knowing as a citizen.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Despite the many frustrations and very real shortcomings associ�ated with government, I believe Americans have, at every level, the most dedicated, capable, and honest public servants anywhere. In my long career in government, I saw in U.S. political appointees and career civil servants, university faculty and staff, men and women in uniform, and intelligence officers in mufti&#x2014;public officials all&#x2014;an extraordinary number of people of the highest quality serving with steadfast integrity and love of this country and what it stands for. They want to be proud of the organizations they work for; they want the admiration and esteem of the citi�zens they serve. They, too, are often frustrated by the shortcom�ings of their institutions.<br> &nbsp;<br> So, what gets in the way of reform? Why is reform of public institutions particularly difficult?<br> &nbsp;<br> For openers, virtually all public bureaucracies report directly or indirectly to elected officials, whether Congress, state legisla�tures, presidents, governors, mayors, or city and county govern�ing boards. Their political interests (getting reelected usually foremost among them) are often in direct conflict with efforts to streamline or reform the institutions they oversee. For exam�ple, despite all the congressional rhetoric about waste and inef�ficiency in the Department of Defense, any effort to cut unneeded programs or facilities (and the related jobs) in members&#x2019; home districts or states invariably provokes howls of outrage and ada�mant opposition. Despite congressional demands for greater integration of American intelligence agencies, members deny intelligence executives (and the president) the authority to actu�ally make that happen. At the same time state legislators rail against tuition increases at public universities, they slash state funding for those same institutions&#x2014;and continue to impose inefficient state bureaucratic procedures that waste taxpayer (and student) dollars and inhibit cost cutting at those same universi�ties. They don&#x2019;t want to relinquish political control even as state funding levels plummet to 10&#x2013;20 percent of operating budgets. In short, politics&#x2014;both local and national&#x2014;is a significant obstacle to reform and adaptive change.<br> &nbsp;<br> But it&#x2019;s not just politics that is the problem. Elective bodies with oversight responsibilities also are unreliable, unpredictable, and even irresponsible when it comes to the lifeblood of public institutions&#x2014;funding.

It unlocks the great themes of spiritual searching that make him a figure of universal religious importance. </p> <p>In this major biography, Dr. Arthur Green&#x2015;teacher, scholar, and spiritual seeker&#x2015;explores the great personal conflicts and inner torments that lay at the source of Nahman&#x2019;s teachings.

While subject to rapid mood swings and even paranoia, Nahman is a model of spiritual and personal struggle who speaks to all generations.

Nahman, both as teller and as hero of these tales, is Nahman the seeker.

The fact that this particular roommate was a Dragon didn't help. Bellusdeo was clean, tidy, and ate very little. She didn't actually require sleep, and for the first couple of nights, that had seemed like a good thing because Kaylin's apartment only had one bed. It only had one room.<br><br>But around morning number four, which had come on the heels of an urgent mirror message from the Guild of Midwives and a hideously touch-and-go birth, the "good thing" developed the preceding words "too damn much of a..."<br><br>Ten days&#x2014;which included three more emergency calls&#x2014;later, Kaylin struggled out of bed when the shadows in the room were far too short, and came face-to-face with someone who looked refreshed and annoyingly cheerful. She always looked refreshed and cheerful, but the annoying part had grown with time and familiarity.<br><br>It was far too late for breakfast, in part because Kaylin hadn't managed to get to the market the previous day and there was no food in the apartment. So she scrounged for clean clothing, taking what little time she had to tend to the large un-hatched egg she slept wrapped around.<br><br>"Kaylin, I think the egg has changed color," Bellusdeo said. She stared at the egg but didn't actually touch it. She did, however, help Kaylin gather the cloth she kept wrapped around it when she left it for the day.<br><br>Kaylin, who was still bleary from sleep and fatigued by the work of the previous night, squinted. "Maybe. Do you think&#x2014;do you think that means it's going to hatch?"<br><br>"I don't know. I don't recognize the species of egg."<br><br>Kaylin pressed her ear against the shell. She could almost hear something moving within it&#x2014;but the sound was so faint it might have been due to hopeful imagination. She considered taking the egg into the office with her, remembered that it was magiclesson day, and decided to take the risk of leaving it untended for the afternoon. It was afternoon by this point, so it would be a shorter absence than usual.<br><br>Bellusdeo then accompanied Kaylin into work.<br><br>Kaylin accepted the barrage of amused mockery her hour of arrival caused with less than her usual grace. She had managed to go almost three weeks without being late. Admittedly on two of those days she'd perambulated around the office like someone doing a good imitation of the walking dead&#x2014;but she'd been timely walking dead, damn it.<br><br>"If you dislike the mockery," Bellusdeo told her as she walked gracefully by Kaylin's side, "why don't you just arrive on time?"<br><br>"I need to sleep."<br><br>"You don't have to go to the midwives' guildhall."<br><br>"If I miss a few hours here in the morning, Marcus snarls at me and I expose my throat for a few minutes. I also win someone some money in the betting pool. If I miss an emergency call from the midwives' guild, someone dies. Guess which is more important?"<br><br>Bellusdeo nodded. "We have an etiquette lesson this evening," the Dragon added. It was true. It was also a subtle reminder that Bellusdeo did make Kaylin's life a little easier, because while Lord Diarmat pretty much despised Kaylin, he couldn't openly treat Bellusdeo with contempt, and Bel-lusdeo had an uncanny knack for asking the direct questions that would have caused mortal offense had they come from Kaylin's mouth. In this case, mortal was accurate.<br><br>Kaylin grimaced and straightened up. "I have a magic lesson in half an hour."<br><br>"With Sanabalis?"<br><br>"The same." Kaylin hesitated and then added, "Do you think you could call him Lord Sanabalis?"<br><br>"Why? You don't. If you don't, I can hardly see that it will make much difference if I fail to do so."<br><br>"It won't make much difference to you. It'll get me in less trouble." She headed toward the reception desk, where Cait-lin was watching their progress down the hall. The mirror dutifully announced the time the minute Kaylin's foot had crossed the threshold. At least it hadn't called her by name.<br><br>"Good afternoon, dear," Caitlin said, rising from her chair. "The midwives called you in last night?"<br><br>Kaylin nodded. "Marya woke me at two in the morning."<br><br>"It was bad?"<br><br>"It was very bad; I almost didn't make it in time."<br><br>"Did you eat anything before you came here?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Bellusdeo lifted a lovely golden brow but said nothing. Not that words actually had to be spoken around Caitlin, who pursed her lips.<br><br>"Lord Sanabalis is waiting for you."<br><br>"Of course he is."<br><br>Bellusdeo didn't actually join her for magic lessons; as a member of the Dragon Court&#x2014;albeit on a technicality&#x2014;she didn't require them. She did, however, go to Elantran language lessons in the East Room for the duration; the Imperial Palace had ordered two linguists to work with her during that time. What the linguists made of Bellusdeo, Kaylin didn't know; she was just grateful for the few moments in which Bellusdeo was someone else's problem.<br><br>"I admit I'm surprised to see you on time, Private," Sanabalis said as she cringed her way through contact with the room's door ward and entered.<br><br>"Oh?"<br><br>"Given the time at which you left your dwelling last evening, I assumed you would be at least an hour late."<br><br>Kaylin sat and folded her arms across her chest. "You're having my apartment watched at two in the morning?"<br><br>Sanabalis didn't answer the question. Instead he said, "How is Bellusdeo adapting to life in the City?"<br><br>"She hasn't changed much since I spoke to you about it two days ago."<br><br>"And have you reconsidered the Emperor's offer to house you in a more suitable location?"<br><br>Sadly, she had. On offer was a much, much larger apartment. It was, however, farther from the office, and Kaylin still held on to the faint hope that Bellusdeo would get tired of living in a run-down, single-room apartment with no privacy and choose to move out on her own.<br><br>So far, Dragon stubbornness was running neck and neck with human stubbornness. It seemed unfair that only the human was suffering. If they had a larger dwelling, Kaylin could have an entire room to herself, and they would have room for Bellusdeo's Ascendant, a Norannir who would only barely fit through Kaylin's current door&#x2014;if he crouched. Mag-garon could keep an eye on Bellusdeo, and Kaylin might actually have a day&#x2014;at work&#x2014;in which she didn't have the Dragon as her constant companion. As it was, that Ascendant, Maggaron, had been exiled to the Tower in the fief of Tiamaris, and he was very, very glum about the separation.<br><br>What she said, however, was "No. We're doing fine." Kaylin's biggest fear was that she would move, lose her small&#x2014;but affordable&#x2014;apartment, and have nowhere else to go when Bellusdeo finally decided to move out. Severn had suggested that she pay her rent while staying in the Imperial building, but it galled Kaylin to spend that much money on something she wasn't even using.<br><br>She glared at her nemesis, the candle.<br><br>Sanabalis folded his hands on the table's surface; it had been newly oiled and waxed, and the Dragon's reflection stared back up at him. "Your etiquette lesson is tonight."<br><br>"I know."<br><br>"You seem to have survived the previous lessons."<br><br>"Yes. So did Diarmat and Bellusdeo."<br><br>Sanabalis winced, but he chuckled, as well. "I believe Lord Diarmat is on the edge of repenting his decision to teach you; he may well ask the Arkon to undertake that duty instead."<br><br>"But he won't fall over that edge until we've suffered at least as much as he has?"<br><br>"Ah, no. I believe he would be more than willing to continue to teach you, but he feels that Bellusdeo is an impediment to your effective absorption of necessary knowledge." Sanabalis nodded at the candle. "Begin."<br><br>* * *<br><br>The entire department heard her shriek.<br><br>Only half of them left their desks to see what had caused it&#x2014;or at least only half of them were visible when Kaylin threw the door open and tried to run through them into the office. She was bouncing.<br><br>"Teela! Tain! I did it!"<br><br>"Whatever you did, kittling," Teela replied, "you broke the silence spell that usually protects us from your cursing during class." She glanced pointedly at the warded door. "What do you think you did?"<br><br>Kaylin spun and pointed.<br><br>The candle's wick was actually burning. She'd been staring at it every class for what felt like years&#x2014;but couldn't have been more than a couple of months in objective time&#x2014;and had even cut it in half in a foul mood. Not once in all those months had the damn thing done what it was supposed to do.<br><br>But today?<br><br>Today she'd almost felt the warmth of fire; she'd grasped and visualized its name. It had taken the better part of an hour to accomplish that much, because it was a large name and parts of it kept sliding out of her grip. It didn't matter; this was the first class she'd had with Sanabalis that hadn't ended in total, frustrating failure.<br><br>Lord Sanabalis rose, and Kaylin hesitated, losing a little of her bounce. "You didn't do it, did you? It was me?"<br><br>"It was you, Private Neya. And because you've succeeded&#x2014;once&#x2014;I will consider today's lesson complete. If you will accompany me?"<br><br>"Pardon?"<br><br>"I believe Lord Grammayre and Sergeant Kassan would like a few words with you. They did want to speak with you earlier, but I felt the matter could wait until after your lesson."<br><br>Yes, because Lord Sanabalis was a Dragon and Lord Grammayre and Sergeant Kassan were only the men responsible for signing off on her pay chit.<br><br>Lord Grammayre and Marcus were waiting in the Hawk-lord's Tower. Kaylin, torn between panic at the length of time they'd been made to wait and worry about the topic of discussion, went up the stairs at a brisk clip, as if rushing to her doom. Dragon knowledge of the effective chain of command in the Halls of Law was pretty simple: the Dragon Court's desires took precedence over everything. It was hard to get that wrong. Their knowledge of the finer details, on the other hand&#x2014;and in particular Kaylin's place in the food chain as a private&#x2014;left a lot to be desired, especially since their pay and their rank weren't ever going to be at risk. She tried not to resent this as Sanabalis, curse him, practically crawled.<br><br>The Tower doors were open, which was a small mercy. Kaylin approached them, the sound of her steps on stone drawing two pairs of distinctive eyes&#x2014;Leontine and Aerian. Marcus's facial fur was standing on end, and his eyes were orange. The Hawklord's wings were slightly extended, and his eyes were a gray-blue. Had she been a flower, she'd've instantly wilted under that much dry heat. Angry Leontine Sergeant, angry Aerian Commander in Chief, slightly bored Dragon, and panicked human&#x2014;you could practically call it a racial congress, with humans in their usual position.<br><br>Marcus was in such a bad mood that he didn't even mention how late she was; he wasn't in a bad enough mood not to growl when she hesitated in the doorway. She crossed the threshold quickly and offered Lord Grammayre a salute. It was as perfect as she could make it&#x2014;and if two weeks under the Draconic Lord Diarmat had given her nothing else, it had certainly improved the quality of necessary gestures of respect, not that she was required to salute a member of the Dragon Court.<br><br>Lord Sanabalis, as a member of said court, wasn't required to offer a salute to anyone in the Halls of Law. Kaylin wasn't certain what formal gestures of respect he offered the Eternal Emperor, because thankfully she'd never seen the Eternal Emperor&#x2014;at least not yet. She'd seen the rest of the Dragons interact with each other, and while they were polite and formal when nothing important was being discussed, they didn't spend all day bowing, saluting, or speaking full titles. She now even knew what their full titles were.<br><br>"At ease, Private." If an order could be guaranteed to make her feel less at ease, she didn't want to hear it. The Hawklord's tone of voice had enough edge to draw blood. She nodded stiffly and dropped her arms to her sides.<br><br>"Lord Sanabalis," the Hawklord continued, "we have news of some import to relay to the Imperial Court."<br><br>"Good. Does it involve the current investigation into the Exchequer?"<br><br>"It does. We have an unexpected lead. Our subsequent investigations have given us reason to believe it is extremely relevant."<br><br>Sanabalis raised a brow. "May I ask the source of that information?"<br><br>"You may; it is the only reason Private Neya is currently present."<br><br>"I will assume that the lead did not come through the Private."<br><br>"No. Not directly. She has been involved as your attache in the fief of Tiamaris for much of the investigation; as she has not yet been released from those duties, she has had no direct involvement in the Exchequer affair."<br><br>Lord Sanabalis nodded.<br><br>"Even if she is no longer required as frequently in the fief, she appears to be the unofficial minder for the newly arrived Lady Bellusdeo."<br><br>Kaylin cringed.<br><br>"Private?" Marcus growled.<br><br>Kaylin cleared her throat. "She doesn't like to be referred to as Lady Bellusdeo."<br><br>"And given her position at the moment, that is understandable. I will endeavor not to cause her the hardship of appropriate Elantran title in future," Lord Grammayre said. "However."<br><br>Sanabalis's eyes had shaded to a pale copper. Kaylin wasn't certain what color her eyes would be if human eye color shifted at the whim of mood; given that she was standing near an angry Leontine, an annoyed Dragon, and an unhappy Aerian, it probably wouldn't be good.<br><br>"What is Private Neya's involvement?"<br><br>The Leontine glared at the Hawklord. The Hawklord pretended not to notice either the glare or the question. "The usual method of paying in Imperial currency for information was rejected; the information, however, was deemed necessary."<br><br>"And?"<br><br>"The information offered to us came via Lord Nightshade of the fief of Nightshade."<br><br>Copper shaded toward orange in the Dragon Lord's eyes. "He offered the information first?"<br><br>"Of course not. But he offered some of the information to indicate the importance of the offer."<br><br>"And the information he did offer was not sufficient for our investigators?"<br><br>"No; if we attempted to investigate thoroughly, we would almost certainly be detected, and any proof of criminal activity would vanish."<br><br>"What was the tidbit he dangled?"<br><br>"The Office of the Exchequer has been working in conjunction with two highly placed Arcanists. Both," he added, "are Barrani, and both might be in possession of some of the embezzled funds."<br><br>Kaylin did not, through dint of will, whistle. She did sneak a glance at Sanabalis; his eyes hadn't gotten any redder, which was a positive sign. On the other hand, Marcus's hadn't gotten any less orange, which was not, given that Marcus now turned the full force of his glare on her. She felt this a tad unfair, given that she'd already warned him what Nightshade would demand in return for the information; she was not, however, feeling suicidal enough to point this out.<br><br>"Were you aware, Private, that the leave of absence requested in return for this information would be extensive?"<br><br>"...How extensive?"<br><br>"The fieflord is asking for a minimum of six weeks if we provide the transport, and a minimum of eight weeks if we do not."<br><br>She blinked. After a moment, she said, "Eight weeks?" thinking, as she did, of her rent. "Eight weeks."<br><br>"I can't take eight weeks off!"<br><br></p><h2>Man of the Family</h2><p>After Father's death, young Ralph became the man of the family in a West that was still not fully tame.

The two cases cross with the news that Masterson's committee to authenticate all known works of Titian had run aground on serious disagreements (how serious? Two more committee members will soon be found dead) and that Masterson herself had developed a mysterious interest in the canvas Jonathan was trying to buy--part of the inheritance of the Marchesa's nephew Dr. Lorenzo, another member of the ill-starred Titian committee.

The book is divided into six sections: 1. The Sea Painter&#39;s World, an introduction to the artist&#39;s studio work at Merton Place, London and his plein air work on the River Thames; 2. Home Waters; 3. The Mediterranean; 4. In the Wake of Nelson; 5. North America and 6. The West Indies and Beyond. This concept sets Geoff&#39;s work in a broadly geographical context, showcasing the artist&#39;s freer plein air style alongside the exhaustively researched maritime history paintings to which he owes his standing as Britain&#39;s leading marine artist.</p><p>Geoff Hunt is a former President of the Royal Society of Marine Artists. His work is represented in public and private collections worldwide, and Geoff is an expert on the Navy of Nelson and Patrick O&#39;Brian. In 2004 The Marine Art of Geoff Hunt was published to much acclaim, presenting over 100 of the artist&#39;s key works from a thirty year career. Geoff&#39;s studio is on the site of Nelson&#39;s house at Merton Place.<p>&#x201c;Another magnificent volume of the work of one of the undisputed foremost maritime artists of our own time, well-known to many of our readers, this one covering many of Geoff Hunt's recent paintings. The last time I had the pleasure of receiving a volume of his paintings was three years ago, the book written and produced together with Brian Lavery on HMS Surprise, containing all the cover paintings of the Patrick O'Brian books as well as a wealth of others.</p><p>This new book covers Geoff Hunt's work since then as well as some earlier paintings. In contrast to the HMS Surprise volume, there is greater diversity of subject here. Though the artist's home period is clearly that of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, we are taken right back to the 16th century with his definitive study of the Mary Rose based on all the researched information now available (culminating in his now well-known 2009 painting reproduced in the book) and right up to the present day HMS Bulwark at the International Fleet review on 28th June 2005, HMS Dragon building at VT Portsmouth and HMS Ark Royal in drydock at Portsmouth in May 2009. Modern sail and port scenes are covered as well.</p><p>Not only is this book as stunning as one would expect for the many beautifully reproduced paintings, but it also affords an insight into the creative processes of the marine artist himself. It takes us through his sources, right back to the 16th Century Anthony Rolls in the case of the Mary Rose painting and research, to preliminary and developing sketches for the final painting and into the artist's studio itself. Several chapters are written as case studies of the evolution of final works of art; apart from HMS Bulwark and Mary Rose we have 'The Mediterranean &#x2013; Case Study III : Jack Aubrey's Port Mahon in 1800'; 'In the Wake of Admiral Nelson &#x2013; Case Study IV : The Battle of the Nile'; 'North America &#x2013; Case Study V : Chasing the Rainbow' and similar. There are several subjects here of particular interest to American members, such as the CSS Alabama sailing from Cherbourg in June 1864 to fight the USS Kearsage and a fine study of the big Humphreys frigate USS United States making passage in a good sailing breeze under all plain sail. Then, 'Under Fire off Manhattan', 'Ranger Goes a-Roving', 'Hancock and Fox', 'The USS Chesapeake leaving Boston Harbor', finally 'USS Constitution at the Battle of Tripoli 1804' and the cover painting for James Nelson's The Continental Risque. Trafalgar is to the fore, and the subsequent Strachan's Action. Our readers will have noticed that Jack Aubrey is still very much in evidence, but so is Hornblower, with 'HMS Hotspur off Brest 1803'; 'Dangerous waters: HMS Renown; HMS Lydia hove down and refitting in the Pacific and 'HMS Sutherland's Last Battle'. There are many more fascinating subjects, from racing tea clippers (The Great Tea Race of 1866') to WWI battlecruisers ('HMS Indomitable entering Grand Harbour, Valetta'). The cover image depicts Sir George Collier's Squadron in Penobscot Bay, 14th August 1779</p><p>Another beautiful book to treasure, from Conway's excellent production team and from one of the very foremost maritime artists working today, the incomparable Geoff Hunt.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Historical Naval Fiction</i></p></p><h2>The Boy Who Would Be a Helicopter</h2><p><p>How does a teacher begin to appreciate and tap the rich creative resources of the fantasy world of children? What social functions do story playing and storytelling serve in the preschool classroom? And how can the child who is trapped in private fantasies be brought into the richly imaginative social play that surrounds him?</p><p><i>The Boy Who Would Be a Helicopter</i> focuses on the challenge posed by the isolated child to teachers and classmates alike in the unique community of the classroom. It is the dramatic story of Jason&#x2015;the loner and outsider&#x2015;and of his ultimate triumph and homecoming into the society of his classmates. As we follow Jason&#x2019;s struggle, we see that the classroom is indeed the crucible within which the young discover themselves and learn to confront new problems in their daily experience.</p><p>Vivian Paley recreates the stage upon which children emerge as natural and ingenious storytellers. She supplements these real-life vignettes with brilliant insights into the teaching process, offering detailed discussions about control, authority, and the misuse of punishment in the preschool classroom. She shows a more effective and natural dynamic of limit-setting that emerges in the control children exert over their own fantasies. And here for the first time the author introduces a triumvirate of teachers (Paley herself and two apprentices) who reflect on the meaning of events unfolding before them.</p></p><p><p>Vivian Gussin Paley (1929&#x2013;2019), a longtime classroom teacher at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, was a MacArthur Fellow and winner of the 1998 American Book Award for Lifetime Achievement.</p>&#x201c;A tour de force...

Amira Mittermaier guides the reader through landscapes of the imagination that feature Muslim dream interpreters who draw on Freud, reformists who dismiss all forms of divination as superstition, a Sufi devotional group that keeps a diary of dreams related to its shaykh, and ordinary believers who speak of moving encounters with the Prophet Muhammad. In close dialogue with her Egyptian interlocutors, Islamic textual traditions, and Western theorists, Mittermaier teases out the dream&#x2019;s ethical, political, and religious implications. Her book is a provocative examination of how present-day Muslims encounter and engage the Divine that offers a different perspective on the Islamic Revival. <i>Dreams That Matter</i> opens up new spaces for an anthropology of the imagination, inviting us to rethink both the imagined and the real.</p><p>"This brilliant study presents contemporary anthropology at its best. Whether one's goal is understanding the permeability of traditions and modernities or the changing shape of religious imagination and thought in one of the most pivotal countries of the Middle East, this book is an outstanding point of departure."&#x2015;Dale F. Eickelman, author of <i>The Middle East and Central Asia: An Anthropological Approach, 4th ed.</i> <br><br>"<i>Dreams That Matter</i> is an insightful and well-crafted study of the practice of dreaming in contemporary Egypt. Mittermaier provides a superb analysis of the imaginative repertoires of Islamic traditions and shows how the dream has remained not only a site of Muslim scholarly interest, but an important part of the way ordinary Muslims encounter and engage with the divine."&#x2015;Charles Hirschkind, author of <i>Powers of the Secular Modern: Talal Asad and His Interlocutors </i> <br><br>"Amira Mittermaier has given us the most complete anthropological study of dream culture in the Middle East&#x2015;perhaps in any culture. It is a sensitive, intellectually challenging, indeed a courageous, investigation of the psychological, ontological, and ethical assumptions that lie behind dreams, visions, and dream-visitations in contemporary Egypt&#x2015;where the dream is a vibrant site of political, religious, and interpretive contest. <i>Dreams That Matter</i> will rank among the most important contributions to the anthropology of the imagination for years to come."&#x2015;Vincent Crapanzano, author of <i>The Harkis: The Wound That Never Heals</i><b>Amira Mittermaier</b> is Associate Professor of Religion at the University of Toronto.</p><h2>Perspectives on Learning (Thinking About Education Series)</h2><p><p>Rather than simply outlining the classical and modern theories of learning, this widely adopted text brings the material to life through case studies that engage students in debates about what really happens in classrooms.

This literature, Asian as well as Western, weaves together the strands of different traditions to create a novel hybrid that brings Buddhism into alignment with many of the ideologies and sensibilities of the post-Enlightenment West.<br> <br> In this book, David McMahan charts the development of this "Buddhist modernism." McMahan examines and analyzes a wide range of popular and scholarly writings produced by Buddhists around the globe. He focuses on ideological and imaginative encounters between Buddhism and modernity, for example in the realms of science, mythology, literature, art, psychology, and religious pluralism. He shows how certain themes cut across cultural and geographical contexts, and how this form of Buddhism has been created by multiple agents in a variety of times and places. His position is critical but empathetic: while he presents Buddhist modernism as a construction of numerous parties with varying interests, he does not reduce it to a mistake, a misrepresentation, or fabrication. Rather, he presents it as a complex historical process constituted by a variety of responses -- sometimes trivial, often profound -- to some of the most important concerns of the modern era.<br></p><p><br><strong>David L. McMahan</strong> is Associate Professor of Religious Studies at Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Pennsylvania. He is the author of <em>Empty Vision: Metaphor and Visionary Imagery in Mahayana Buddhism</em> and of articles on both Buddhism in South Asia and Buddhism and modernity.<br><br>"With David McMahan's <em>The Making of Buddhist Modernism</em>, the study of modern Buddhism has reached a new level of maturity. This sweeping and sophisticated analysis of the ways in which westerners and Asians alike have constructed new forms of Buddhism under the pressures of modernity is thoroughly disillusioning, in the best sense of the word. McMahan shows that much of what has been written and said about Buddhism in the modern era only can be understood against the background of dominant western discourses. Trenchant but fair, erudite yet lucid, this book should be required reading for any serious student of Buddhism, and will be appreciated as well by those interested in intellectual history, cultural studies, or, simply, the inquiry into modernity." --Roger R. Jackson, Stephen R. Lewis, Jr. Professor of Religion and the Liberal Arts, Carleton College<p></p><br>"David McMahan offers readers a theoretically sophisticated analysis of the development of new modes of thought and discourse in the Buddhist religion since the latter part of the nineteenth century. Grounded in a sound understanding of premodern Buddhist ideas, this work effectively unravels the complex ways in which 'Buddhism' has been adapted to fit the theoretical commitments and tacit understandings of people living in the modern world." --Stephen C. Berkwitz, Associate Professor of Religious Studies, Missouri State University<p></p><br>"This is an exceptionally well-written and imaginative piece of scholarship. David McMahan treats in great depth many different facets of Buddhist modernism including art and creativity, meditation and monastic ideals, and science. The writing is clear, straightforward and to the point, and reflects an excellent understanding of how Buddhism fits into the larger scheme of modern religiosity and the development of modern society more generally." --Steven Heine, author of <em>Zen Skin, Zen Marrow: Will the Real Zen Buddhism Please Stand Up?</em><p></p><br></p><h2>MyVirtualChild</h2><p>This interactive simulation offers students the opportunity to act as a parent and raise a virtual child.

The ways in which the African world perceives itself as a cultural entity, and the differences between its essential unity of experience and literary form and the sense of division pervading Western literature, are just some of the issues addressed. The centrality of ritual gives drama a prominent place in Soyinka&#39;s discussion, but he deals in equally illuminating ways with contemporary poetry and fiction. Above all, the fascinating insights in this book serve to highlight the importance of African criticism in addition to the literary and cultural achievements which are the subject of its penetrating analysis.</p><p>The ways in which the African world perceives itself as a cultural whole that interconnects myth, ritual and literature and the differences between its essential unity and the sense of division pervading Western literature are emphasized in this classic analysis.One of the foremost living African writers here analyses the interconnecting worlds of myth, ritual and literature in Africa.

The Indian slave trade was of central importance from the Carolina coast to the Mississippi Valley for nearly fifty years, linking southern lives and creating a whirlwind of violence and profit-making, argues Alan Gallay. He documents in vivid detail how the trade operated, the processes by which Europeans and Native Americans became participants, and the profound consequences for the South and its peoples.<br><br>The author places Native Americans at the center of the story of European colonization and the evolution of plantation slavery in America. He explores the impact of such contemporary forces as the African slave trade, the unification of England and Scotland, and the competition among European empires as well as political and religious divisions in England and in South Carolina. Gallay also analyzes how Native American societies approached warfare, diplomacy, and decisions about allying and trading with Europeans. His wide-ranging research not only illuminates a crucial crossroad of European and Native American history but also establishes a new context for understanding racism, colonialism, and the meaning of ethnicity in early America.<br><br></p><p>Winner of the 2003 Bancroft Prize&#34;The book is essential reading for scholars of early American and Native American history. . . .

This volume presents new translations of Cause, Principle and Unity, in which he challenges Aristotelian accounts of causality and spells out the implications of Copernicanism for a new theory of an infinite universe, as well as two essays on magic, in which he interprets earlier theories about magical events in the light of the unusual powers of natural phenomena.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Italian&#34;The works of Giordano Bruno have for so long been confined to the Renaissance tradition of Hermeticism and magic, as they were presented by Frances Yates...that it is heartening to find some of them included in the Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy, edited by Desmond Clarke.

Less than a year later, in an affectionate attempt to trick his friend, Diderot created this masterpiece - a fictitious set of desperate and pleading letters to the Marquis from a teenage girl forced into the nunnery because she is illegitimate. In these letters, the impressionable and innocent Suzanne Simonin describes the cruelty and abuse she has suffered in an institution poisoned by vicious gossip, intrigues, persecutions and deviance. Considered too subversive during Diderot's lifetime, <i>The Nun </i>first appeared in print in 1796 following the Revolution. Part gripping novel, part licentious portrayal of sexual fervour and part damning attack on oppressive religious institutions, it remains one of the most utterly original works of the many eighteenth-century.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Readers trust the&nbsp;series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date&nbsp;translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>Denis Diderot (1713-84), editor of the Encyclopedie and supreme figure of the Enlightenment, began writing The Nun as a practical joke.The joke got out of hand and resulted in one of the most remarkable novels of the eighteenth century. Through the story of a girl without a religious vocation, enclosed against her will in the unnatural environment of a convent, Diderot takes issue with misconceived Christianity in a social system where the civil law protects the persecutor and penalizes the victim. In an atmosphere intense with gossip, intrigues, favouritism, persecutions and pettiness, Diderot exposes the young nun to what he regards as the four great dangers of convent life: madness, the paralysing effect of a powerful saintly personality, sadistic cruelty, and febrile sexuality.Denis Diderot was born at Langres in eastern France in 1713. After graduating in Paris in 1732, he was nominally a law student for ten years, but was actually leading a precarious bohemian but studious existence. In the early 1740s he met three contemporaries who were of great significance to him and to the age: a&#39;Alembert, Condillac and Rousseau, who assisted Diderot in the compilation of the Encyclopedie, which he worked on until its completion in 1773. Interested in the mind-body dichotomy, his work was a bold mixture of science and philosophy. He died in 1784.</p><h2>Confessions of a Murder Suspect (Confessions, 1)</h2><p><b>James Patterson returns to the genre that made him famous with a #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling teen detective novel about the mysterious Angel family . . . and the dark secrets they're keeping from one another.</b><b><br></b>On the night Malcolm and Maud Angel are murdered, Tandy Angel knows just three things: 1) She was the last person to see her parents alive. 2) The police have no suspects besides Tandy and her three siblings. 3) She can't trust anyone-maybe not even herself.<br>As Tandy sets out to clear the family name, she begins to recall flashes of experiences long buried in her vulnerable psyche.

No one in their whole world could do the Creeks harm, and they welcomed the slight white man who came with gifts and promises to enjoy the hospitality of their invincible towns.</p><p>Their reputation as warriors and diplomats, during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, extended to the most distant reaches of the Indian country. Secure in their careless strength, friendly toward the white man until his encroachment made them resentful and desperate, they learned that they had no guile to match broken promises, and no disciplined courage to provide unity against white ruthlessness. Broken, dissembled, and their ranks depleted by the Creek and Seminole wars, they were subjected to that shameful and tragic removal which forced all the Five Civilized Tribes to a new home in the untried wilderness west of the Mississippi.</p><p>There, when they found the land good, they revitalized their shattered tribal institutions and rebuilt them upon the pattern of the American constitutional republic. But contentment again was short-lived as they were encircled by the encroaching white man with his hunger for land, his herds of cattle, and his desire for lumber, minerals, and railway concessions. They were faced, moreover, with internal political strife, and split by the sectionalism of the Civil War. Yet, they still survived in native steadfastness-a trait which is characteristic of the Creek-until the final denouement produced by the Dawes Act.</p><p>In <i>The Road to Disappearance, </i>Miss Debo tells for the first time the full Creek story from its vague anthropological beginnings to the loss by the tribe of independent political identity, when during the first decade of this century the lands of the Five Civilized Tribes were divided into severalty ownership. Her book is an absorbing narrative of a minority people, clinging against all odds to native custom, language, and institution. It is the chronicle of the internal life of the tribe&#x2014;the structure of Creek society&#x2014;with its folkways, religious beliefs, politics, wars, privations, and persecutions. Miss Debo's research has divulged many new sources of information, and her history of the Creeks since the Civil War is a special contribution because that period has been largely neglected by the historians of the American Indian.</p><p>"The vitality of our race still persists," said a Creek orator. "We have not lived for naught.... We have given to the European people on this continent our thought forces-the best blood of our ancestors having intermingled with that of their best statesmen and leading citizens. We made ourselves an indestructible element in their national history. We have shown that what they believed were arid and desert places were habitable and capable of sustaining millions of people.... The race that has rendered this service to the other nations of mankind cannot utterly perish."</p></p><p><p><strong>Angie Debo</strong> was reared in a pioneer community, at Marshall, Oklahoma, where it has been her privilege to know from childhood the folkways of the Indians and the traditions of the western settlers. A member of her community high school's first graduating class, she later attended the University of Oklahoma, where she was a Phi Beta Kappa, and took her B.A. and later her Ph.D. degree; she received her master's degree from the University of Chicago. Her education was combined with intervals of teaching in country schools, starting at the age of sixteen.</p> <p>Miss Debo's distinguished reputation as a regional scholar has been enhanced by her book, <em>The Rise and.

Agesilaus. Constitution of the Lacedaemonians. Ways and Means. Cavalry Commander. Art of Horsemanship. On Hunting. Constitution of the Athenians) Loeb Classical Library</h2><p><p>Xenophon (ca. 430 to ca. 354 BCE) was a wealthy Athenian and friend of Socrates. He left Athens in 401 and joined an expedition including ten thousand Greeks led by the Persian governor Cyrus against the Persian king. After the defeat of Cyrus, it fell to Xenophon to lead the Greeks from the gates of Babylon back to the coast through inhospitable lands. Later he wrote the famous vivid account of this 'March Up-Country' (<i>Anabasis</i>); but meanwhile he entered service under the Spartans against the Persian king, married happily, and joined the staff of the Spartan king, Agesilaus. But Athens was at war with Sparta in 394 and so exiled Xenophon. The Spartans gave him an estate near Elis where he lived for years writing and hunting and educating his sons. Reconciled to Sparta, Athens restored Xenophon to honour but he preferred to retire to Corinth.</p><p>Xenophon's <i>Anabasis</i> is a true story of remarkable adventures. <i>Hellenica,</i> a history of Greek affairs from 411 to 362, begins as a continuation of Thucydides' account. There are four works on Socrates (collected in Volume IV of the Loeb Xenophon edition). In <i>Memorabilia</i> Xenophon adds to Plato's picture of Socrates from a different viewpoint. The <i>Apology</i> is an interesting complement to Plato's account of Socrates' defense at his trial. Xenophon's <i>Symposium</i> portrays a dinner party at which Socrates speaks of love; and <i>Oeconomicus</i> has him giving advice on household management and married life. <i>Cyropaedia,</i> a historical romance on the education of Cyrus (the Elder), reflects Xenophon's ideas about rulers and government; the Loeb edition is in two volumes.</p><p>We also have his <i>Hiero,</i> a dialogue on government; <i>Agesilaus,</i> in praise of that king; <i>Constitution of Lacedaemon</i> (on the Spartan system); <i>Ways and Means</i> (on the finances of Athens); <i>Manual for a Cavalry Commander;</i> a good manual of <i>Horsemanship;</i> and a lively <i>Hunting with Hounds. The Constitution of the Athenians,</i> though clearly not by Xenophon, is an interesting document on politics at Athens. These eight books are collected in the last of the seven volumes of the Loeb Classical Library edition of Xenophon.</p></p><p><p>Edgar Cardew Marchant (1864&#x2013;1960) was Sub-Rector of Lincoln College, Oxford.</p><p>G.

This time we will learn from our mistakes. The new planet will be home to the universe's first advanced civilization. It will be a democracy &#x2013; because whatever we say in public, the Eastern Caliphate isn't going to be allowed within a yatto-mile of the place. We'll shoot 'em down before they land.

Just fucked it to death and kicked it when it wouldn't get up.'<br><br>'I know how you feel. I don't say you're entirely wrong in your analysis, but that isn't the way we can present the situation. The President has sent a memo this morning to instruct Enhancement Services and Media Services to work together on this. We don't want any stupid questions &#x2013; any difficulties. The last thing the Central Power needs now is any unrest of our own.

So the farm is leased to Living Museum and I am enslaved to you.'<br><br>'You don't get many scientists coming across to work in Enhancement ... It's not exactly a career move.'<br><br>I had a feeling that something else was here &#x2013; one of those ice-bound conversations that skate over the corpse in the lake. 'Is there a problem with my work?'<br><br>Manfred shrugged. 'Like I said, a Science Service high-flyer doesn't need to take a job with Enhancement.'<br><br>'You work for Enhancement.'<br><br>He was getting impatient. 'Billie, I'm going to be running the whole shooting match within two years. I have a graph. I have a Promotion Plan. I'm heading for the top floor.' (Yep, there he goes, Penthouse Man.) 'You aren't heading anywhere. You could have been promoted to Management within six months, but you're still on the ground, visiting people in their homes.'<br><br>'That's me, a cross between a District Nurse and an Insurance Salesman.'<br><br>'What's a District Nurse?'<br><br>'Never mind. History is a hobby of mine. It's not illegal, and neither is the farm, and neither is wanting a simple life. No graph, no Promotion Plan. OK?'<br><br>'OK. OK.'<br><br>He held up his hands. He turned to leave. 'Oh, you should move your Solo. Enforcement just gave you a ticket.'<br><br>'But I have a permit!'<br><br>'Take it up with Enforcement.'<br><br>'Manfred, this has been going on for a year &#x2013; I clear them, they start again. I'm not paranoid, but if someone is out to get me, I would like to know.'<br><br>'No one is out to get you. But move the Solo. I would if I were you.'<br><br>He swung his handsome body and handsome head out and away to higher things.<br><br>Manfred is one of those confident men who have had themselves genetically Fixed as late-forties. Most men prefer to Fix younger than that, and there are no women who Fix past thirty. 'The DNA Dynasty', they called us, when the first generation of humans had successful recoding. Age is information failure. The body loses fluency. Command stations no longer connect with satellite stations. Relay breaks down. The body is designed to repair and renew itself, and most cells are only about a third as old as our birth years, but mitochondrial DNA is as old as we are, and has always accumulated mutations and distortions faster than DNA in the nucleus.

This book presents the astonishing story of Dr. Burzynski&#39;s revolutionary discovery of antineoplastons, the century&#39;s most promising cancer treatment--and the government&#39;s decade-long effort to suppress information about it. 30 photos.</p><p>Stanislaw Burzynski was born to a well-to-do family in Poland in 1942. While in medical school, he became involved in research and eventually discovered peptides in blood and urine that warranted further study as anticancer agents. In 1970, about to be drafted into the army, Burzynski left for the U.S. Given a chance to continue his research in Houston, Burzynski ultimately developed antineoplastons and established a large clinic. During the next 25 years, some 2,500 patients came to him; many of them had "failed" with the generally accepted chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Burzynski infused them with antineoplastons through a chest catheter, achieving successful results in a substantial number of cases. The FDA and organized medicine, however, launched political and legal attacks against him. Elias, whose partisanship is plain, interweaves Burzynski's story and the stories of some of his patients.Thorough scientific studies seem necessary to clarify the currently murky status of Burzynski's treatment. <i>William Beatty</i></p><h2>Rurouni Kenshin, Vol. 16</h2><p>Packed with action, romance and historical intrigue, <i><b>Rurouni Kenshin</b></i> is one of the most beloved and popular manga series worldwide.

The corners of her mouth lifted as she remembered the day that had set her fate.<br> Her brothers Henry and Richard, then fourteen and twelve respectively, had a ferret in a sack and were off to hunt rabbits. &#x201c;Wait for me!&#x201d; she cried imperiously, struggling to pull on her shoes over feet still wet from paddling in the fishpond.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not coming, Maggot!&#x201d; cried King Henry.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You bugger! Stop calling me that,&#x201d; she screamed furiously.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell Nanny you swear,&#x201d; six-year-old Isabella said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eleanor looked at her sister with contempt. &#x201c;She knows I swear ... you still pee yourself.&#x201d;<br> Joanna said from the lofty wisdom of her ten years, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not to leave the garden. If you go off with the boys again I shall tell on you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Eleanor snatched up the sack that held the ferret and thrust it at Joanna. Screwing her face into that of a hideous gargoyle, she threatened, &#x201c;If you tell, you will find a ferret in your bed some dark night.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Joanna screamed, then took little Isabella by the hand. &#x201c;Come away, she&#x2019;s wicked.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Richard, Duke of Cornwall, cuffed Eleanor across the ear and took the sack from her. &#x201c;Go and play with the girls, Maggot, you&#x2019;re not coming with us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She dug determined little fists into her hips and stuck out a belligerant chin. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t let me come with you, I shall tell that you chase the maids and give them belly-burns with your newly sprouted whiskers.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Maggot-faced little bitch,&#x201d; swore adolescent Henry.<br> &nbsp;<br> Richard, although younger than the king, was stronger and more dominant. He suddenly threw back his head and laughed. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s no bigger than a piss-ant, yet she rules the roost one way or another. Come on, Maggot, I&#x2019;ll bet you don&#x2019;t have the stomach for this sport anyway.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In all truth she did not have the stomach for it. She watched in fascinated horror as her brothers slipped the slinky creature down a rabbit hole, then waited with a sack at the other end of the warren for the terrified bunny to pop out. All her sympathies were with the rabbits, and her heart was wrung over the furry brown creatures who went into shock from fear.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her brothers laughed at her tears and she dashed them away with grimy fingers, leaving rivulets of dirt streaking her face. She felt sick and hurried off in the direction of the palace before they could witness her disgrace herself. To her dismay they followed her, laughing, teasing, and taunting her because she&#x2019;d allowed them to glimpse her vulnerability.<br> &nbsp;<br> Henry was golden-haired like his grandfather the great King Henry II, and Richard&#x2019;s head was russet like his namesake uncle Richard the Lionhearted. Eleanor, the baby of the family, was the only one who had inherited the darkness of their father and mother, the hated King John and Queen Isabella of Angoul�me. They used her coloring to tease her unmercifully.<br> &nbsp;<br> Richard said, &#x201c;Did you ever notice how much the child resembles a black cockroach?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Henry laughed. &#x201c;The last one of a litter is always a runt, but she&#x2019;s so little I suspect she&#x2019;s a dwarf.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Eleanor had never felt so miserable. She was nauseated, hot, and tired, and now a pain shot through her heel. She stopped running, took off her shoe, and saw a large raw blister. &#x201c;Oh, balls!&#x201d; she muttered, and threw the offending slipper into a bramble bush.<br> &nbsp;<br> They caught up with her just as the palace came into view.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s just arrived,&#x201d; Richard said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the marshal!&#x201d; Henry cried happily, recognizing the device of the Red Lion Rampant on a white field.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eleanor&#x2019;s miseries dissolved like snow in summer. Saved by the marshal. Oh, how she loved him!<br> &nbsp;<br> The king and the Duke of Cornwall greeted William Marshal, one of their beloved guardians, a full ten minutes before Eleanor&#x2019;s little legs carried her into his glorious presence. She tugged on his surcoat. &#x201c;My lord earl, My lord earl!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He bent and picked her up, then sat down on a stone bench in the shaded courtyard. Her face was now wreathed with smiles beneath the grime. &#x201c;Sweetheart, you&#x2019;ve been crying! Tell William what&#x2019;s amiss.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Henry and Richard exchanged impatient glances. They wanted William Marshal&#x2019;s undivided attention for themselves. He was their father figure, their mentor, and their hero all rolled into one.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m ugly, like a little black cockroach,&#x201d; whispered Eleanor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her words startled Will Marshal momentarily, and he fished in a pocket for a sweetmeat while he searched for words to comfort the child. Her eyes lit up at the sight of the sugared mouse, and she sucked it contentedly as she nestled in the crook of his arm to listen to his soothing voice.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Once upon a time there was a handsome king and a beautiful queen who had a brood of towheaded children. Then along came the last one and, as is often the case, the last was the best. When the king saw how beautiful she was, he was well pleased. She had black silken curls and eyes the deep blue of sapphires. He told the queen, &#x2018;She is my precious jewel,&#x2019; and ever after she was known as the King&#x2019;s Precious Jewel.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Me!&#x201d; Eleanor said, having heard the phrase all her life. She looked at Henry and said solemnly, &#x201c;And I shall marry the marshal and live happily ever after.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Eleanor&#x2019;s mind returned to the present, and she stared at her face in the mirror. In spite of the touseled hair and sunburn, she knew she was beautiful. It had taken four long years to secure her heart&#x2019;s desire. Four years of manipulating her brother King Henry into persuading William Marshal to wed her. An old superstition ran through her mind: &#x201c;Be careful what you wish for in case it comes true.&#x201d; She laughed at her own silliness. She loved William Marshal with all her heart and all her soul and all her mind. After today he would be hers forever.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her chamber door was thrown open and a gaggle of nursemaids filed in to prepare their charge for her wedding. Princess Eleanor Katherine Plantagenet was nine years old.<br> &nbsp;<br> Will Marshal&#x2019;s eyes told nothing of his true feelings on this wedding day. He thought his black velvet doublet emblazoned back and front with the scarlet lions ridiculously ostentatious. His tastes were those of a plain soldier, yet he realized what was expected of the head of the wealthiest family in England. All the Marshals who had gathered for the ceremony had married well. His brothers had wed into the noblest families, his sisters married to the Earls of Gloucester, Derby, and Norfolk.<br> &nbsp;<br> He sighed. It was only fitting, he supposed, that the head of the Marshals should marry into the royal family. Yet when Henry had offered him Princess Eleanor he had recoiled in horror. He had made the excuse that she was a child and it would take too many years before she could become a real wife to him, but the truth of the matter was he loathed the little girl&#x2019;s mother and feared the princess would become a beautiful, promiscuous replica.<br> &nbsp;<br> Poor little imp, he thought sadly. What a frightening thought to be born in the image of her father and mother. King John had been the worst King England had ever known and had been hated by all. He had been both venal and vile, and the entire world was relieved that he was dead. Queen Isabella had been a voluptuary at the tender age of fourteen. When his duties took him into the king&#x2019;s bedchamber, her sensuality had disgusted him. She&#x2019;d been a wretched mother. Before John was cold in his grave and Eleanor one year old, she had abandoned them all and married her previous lover, Hugh de Lusignan, and before the little mite had turned four years old, like a bitch in heat Isabella had produced a litter of three sons, William, Guy, and Aymer de Lusignan. He only prayed to heaven that Queen Isabella&#x2019;s tainted blood had not been passed on to her offspring. What a nest of vipers they could become when they realized the corrupting power royal blood could wield.<br> &nbsp;<br> He took up two silver-backed brushes and ran them through his thick brown hair, noticing for the first time that it was sprinkled with gray. He had been relieved when Henry&#x2019;s council had rejected the idea of the marriage. Since the Princess Isabella had married the Emperor of Germany and the Princess Joanna had become a queen by marrying King Alexander of Scotland, they also wanted a royal marriage for Eleanor. King Henry had been incensed with his council. He was ever at odds with them, chafing at the fact that he was a boy-king, but a few weeks before he reached his majority of eighteen he again put the matter before his council, informing them that he wished to give his beloved Marshal of England the King&#x2019;s Precious Jewel, Eleanor. He told them in no uncertain terms that if they objected, they would be overruled the moment he became eighteen.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>A Do It At Home Retreat: The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola</h2><p>A most helpful and careful guide to anyone who desires to make an Ignatian retreat but is unable to make the Spiritual Exercises in a normal retreat.

In my gastroenterology practice, the Digestive Center for Women, I&#x2019;ve helped deflate thousands of women and get them comfortably back into their skinny jeans&#x2014;and chances are I can do the same for you.<br> &nbsp;<br> From air swallowing to yeast infections and everything in between, there&#x2019;s always a reason for why you&#x2019;re bloated. Some require just a simple fix, such as switching to a cough medicine that doesn&#x2019;t contain codeine, giving an underactive thyroid a little bloat-busting boost, or identifying a soy allergy that&#x2019;s filling you up with gas. Others are more complex, such as figuring out how to repair a damaged intestinal lining that might be leaking, rebalancing out-of-whack gut bacteria, or speeding up transit time through a sluggish colon. Understanding all the different factors that conspire to bloat you&#x2014;and having a toolbox of integrative solutions to deal with them&#x2014;is the key to banishing your bloat for good.<br> &nbsp;<br> Most of the things that bloat you are benign and fixable, but knowing the signs and symptoms of more worrisome causes that require immediate medical attention is also important. You&#x2019;ll find essential information about those serious sources of bloating here, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> The good news is you&#x2019;re just a few pages away from identifying the root cause of your bloating. By the time you get to the end of this book, you should be as flat as a pancake. Let&#x2019;s get started!<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Aerophagia</b><br> It&#x2019;s normal to swallow a little air when you eat or drink, especially if you&#x2019;re drinking carbonated beverages such as seltzer, beer, soda, or champagne. But as the day progresses, if you feel like the Michelin Woman and fantasize about deflating your stomach with a pin (not a good idea!), you may be swallowing large amounts of air on a regular basis&#x2014;a condition called aerophagia, which can lead to a massive buildup of gas in your gastrointestinal (GI) tract and major bloating.<br> &nbsp;<br> Aerophagia is incredibly common but very underdiagnosed, and it&#x2019;s frequently confused with conditions such as ulcers, gallstones, and bacterial overgrowth that can also cause abdominal discomfort and bloating. Most people with aerophagia complain of three main symptoms: bloating, burping, and a tense, distended stomach that feels like an overinflated tire. If you have chronic sinus problems, a deviated septum, or a history of allergies or asthma, you may be a mouth breather rather than nose breather, which predisposes you to aerophagia. Chewing gum, sucking on hard candy, smoking, eating too quickly, talking when you&#x2019;re eating, drinking lots of liquids with your meals, or holding your breath when you&#x2019;re anxious can all cause aerophagia.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eventually most of the air you&#x2019;ve swallowed will get burped up or make its way through your GI tract and exit via the other end, but not without causing a lot of bloat in between.<br> &nbsp;<br> Solution<br> If you&#x2019;re bloated and think you may have aerophagia, try these tips:<br> � Spit out the gum and hard candy.<br> � Eat slowly and mindfully.<br> � Don&#x2019;t talk on the phone while eating.<br> � Save drinking liquids for the beginning or end of the meal.<br> � Drink flat, not bubbly, water and beverages.<br> � Try some meditation if you feel anxious.<br> � Practice taking deep breaths that expand your lungs, not your stomach.<br> � If you&#x2019;re still feeling bloated, a speech pathologist may help you identify whether the problem is related to your speech, swallowing, or breathing patterns.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Birth Control Pills</b><br> Birth control pills (BCPs) contain various forms of estrogen that can be very bloating. If you&#x2019;re on a high-estrogen BCP, deflating your midsection may be extremely challenging due to fluid and salt retention as well as weight gain. These pills are associated with insulin resistance, a condition that can interfere with your ability to lose weight, especially if you eat a lot of carbohydrates.<br> &nbsp;<br> If you already have a tendency toward insulin resistance or are prediabetic, you may be more likely to become bloated and gain weight from BCPs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Solution<br> Weight gain of more than 5 percent of your total body weight after starting BCPs may be a sign of insulin resistance and should prompt a discussion with your doctor about a glucose tolerance test to diagnose it. Using an alternative nonhormonal form of birth control or choosing a BCP with the lowest amount of estrogen possible makes sense if bloating, weight gain, or insulin resistance is an issue. Ironically, going off BCPs can lead to temporary bloating and constipation due to ovulation starting again, especially if you&#x2019;ve been on the pill for a long time.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Cruciferous Vegetables</b><br> All gas and bloating is not created equal. Beans and cruci ferrous vegetables such as cabbage, cauliflower, kale, and broccoli contain potent cancer-fighting compounds and lots of healthy fiber, but they also contain a starch called raffinose that your body can&#x2019;t fully break down and digest. Bacteria in your colon ferment raffinose and produce methane, which you may experience as bloating accompanied by smelly gas. This is what I consider good gas, though, because it&#x2019;s accompanied by the health benefits that eating those foods confer.<br> &nbsp;<br> Solution<br> I never recommend completely eliminating the &#x201c;good gas&#x201d; foods, because they contain lots of nutrients, but here are some things you can do to cut down on your gas when eating them:<br> � If you haven&#x2019;t been eating foods such as broccoli, kale, and cauliflower, start with a small amount and gradually increase your serving size to let your body get acclimated to them.<br> � Add lemon juice to your good-gas veggies to stimulate digestive enzymes.<br> � Soak dried beans overnight before cooking.<br> � Avoid canned beans, which tend to cause more gas and may also contain a chemical called bisphenol A in the can lining, which has been linked to cancer and other conditions.<br> � Cook beans with a sea vegetable such as kombu (found at Asian markets and health food stores), which makes them more digestible because it contains the enzyme needed to break down raffinose.<br> � Take Beano or Bean-zyme at the start of a meal; both contain a plant-derived enzyme that breaks down raffinose.<br> � Eat a pinch (about &#x215b; teaspoon) of fennel seeds or chew on a stalk of raw fennel at the end of a meal to benefit from its gas-reducing oils. You can also make fennel tea by steeping a teaspoon of crushed seeds or fresh fennel bulbs in a cup of boiling water for ten minutes, or you can add it to salads or cooked dishes.</p><h2>Luke (Abingdon New Testament Commentaries)</h2><p>In this volume, Robert C. Tannehill focuses on the significance of the Gospel of Luke in its final form for its original audience.

While the troops of the US Marine Corps and later the US Army battled the Japanese occupiers on the densely jungled island of Guadalcanal, the US and Japanese naval forces fought a series of tightly contested battles in the waters nearby. The first of these, the battle of Savo Island on the night of 9 August 1942, saw the Japanese inflict a sever defeat on the Allied force, driving them away from Guadalcanal and leaving the just-landed marines in a perilously exposed position. This was the start of a series of night battles that culminated in the First and Second battles of Guadalcanal, fought on the nights of 13 and 15 November, that were narrowly won by US Naval forces and prevented the Japanese from reinforcing their troops on the island to any great extent, and heralded the turning of the tide in the battle for Guadalcanal. One further major naval action followed, the battle of Tassafaronga on 30 November 1942, when the US Navy once again suffered a severe defeat, but this time it was too late to alter the course of the battle as the Japanese evacuated Guadalcanal in early February 1943.This title will detail the contrasting fortunes experienced by both sides over the intense course of naval battles around the island throughout the second half of 1942 that did so much to turn the tide in the Pacific.</p><p>Mark E.

The description of the battles is superbly done and tells a great series of tales without breaking into the sort of hyperbole that was so common in post-war accounts of these events.

Though the subject of this unfinished masterpiece is historical, many of its features are characteristic of epic poetry: Rousing battle scenes; tales of witches, monsters, and miracle; detailed catalogues; intricate similes; and speeches with a high degree of rhetorical elegance. However, Lucan's deft mix of humor and horror, of political satire, literary parody, history, and epic is entirely his own.</p><p>Jane Wilson Joyce's superb translation conveys the drama and poetry of the original. Her use of natural English rhythms in a loose six-beat line comes close to matching the original Latin hexameters, wile her language preserves Lucan's sequence of images.

PLB $8.95; pap. $2.95. PreSGrade 2 No doubt that those children who love the original ``Curious George'' titles (Houghton) will choose to read these booksbut they will surely be disappointed. The text, adapted from a film series, is trite. The plots are slight and lack the richness of language found in the orignal titles. The illustrations seem to be blurry prints of some of the film frames. Even the layout of the text with the illustrations is stagnant. In each of the four books, George is confronted with a problem of singular dimension that he resolves as a result of his curiosity. Children who are just beginning to read about this inquisitive primate will be best served by the many ``original'' titles still in print; the language in them is more stimulating, the plots more satisfying, and the illustrations and layout more interesting.

Dreaming Me is the story of her life, as a child growing up in the Jim Crow South, dealing with racism in an Ivy League college, and becoming involved with the Black Panther Party. But it wasn&#39;t until meeting Lama Yeshe, a Tibetan Buddhist monk living in the mountains of Nepal, that she realized who the real Jan Willis was, and how to make the most of the life she was living.</p><p>Jan Willis is Professor Emerita of Religion at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut.

Along the way, she unfolds a surprising new take on the story of our time: how the germ theory of disease joined with a profit-based economy, and unwittingly led to a &#x201c;sterilization&#x201d; of medicine, agriculture, and even our social lives. This 150-year detour has brought about the near destruction of our climate as well as a great forgetting of the power of connection. By documenting a scientific understanding of the intelligence of the whole, Pershouse nudges us awake with a hopeful view and shows us how to reclaim the rich, &#x201c;fertile&#x201d; lives we are meant for.</p><p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Didi Pershouse is the founder of the Center for Sustainable Medicine, where she developed a model for systems-based ecological medicine that restores health to individuals as well as the social and natural communities around them. Over the past 22 years, her health-care practice has expanded in its scope from treating individual patients to treating whole systems. In addition to raising two sons and seeing patients in Thetford Center, Vermont, she also travels and teaches around the continent with the Soil Carbon Coalition. She teaches about the interrelationships between healthy soils, shifting weather patterns, economic forces, and human health; trains community leaders in self-care and peer support; develops curricula about biological work and landscape function; and works with farmers and ranchers to restore the living systems that run the underground carbon and water cycles that make life on this planet possible.<br> ABOUT THE ILLUSTRATOR Peter Donovan is the founder of the Soil Carbon Coalition.

In 1965, amid worldwide conjecture, Guevara left Cuba, where he was a minister in Fidel Castro&#39;s postrevolutionary government, and traveled incognito to the heart of Africa. People&#39;s hero Patrice Lumumba had recently been assassinated, and Guevara was to put his theories of guerrilla warfare to use helping the oppressed people of the Congo throw off the yoke of colonial imperialism. The first task was to assist the young Laurent Kabila in his struggle against Mobutu and Tshombe, the two key figures in the newly independent nation. For the first time, The African Dream collects Guevara&#39;s unabridged journals of the expedition. They are the record of the bitter failure of a political and ideological dream, and a telling complement to the subsequent rise of Kabila and his recent demise. Most of all, the diaries afford the reader a very personal insight into the thoughts and emotions of Che Guevara, the twentieth century&#39;s great revolutionary martyr.</p><p>"This is the history of a failure." With these words, Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary and leftist icon killed in Bolivia in 1967, launches into a brutally honest account of Cuba's disastrous 1965 intervention in Congo. Guevara traveled to Congo to foment a Communist revolution in a country that then as now was in a state of anarchy. But as he readily admits, he was unable to mobilize his Cuban forces and Congolese allies into a cohesive force. Much of the blame he lays at the feet of the Congolese, "the poorest example of a fighter that I have ever come across to now." But Guevara's ruminations about the frustrations of his insurgency are only part of these "war diaries." Guevara's correspondence with Congolese guerrilla leaders is also included, as are his often negative comments on these leaders. Throughout, Guevara, who was trained as a doctor, displays the analytical mind that made him famous. For example, in hindsight, his prediction that Laurent Kabila was the only guerrilla leader with the potential to rise to the top looks prescient, since Kabila ruled the Congo for a time in the 1990s. Readers looking for an introduction to Che will want to consult the recent comprehensive biography by journalist Jon Lee Anderson but no matter their ideology, readers will find that these writings further their understanding of one of the late 20th century's most intriguing historical figures. 8 pages b&amp;w photos not seen by PW. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>In June 1960, the Congo gained independence from Belgium following dramatic events led by left-wing Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba. Following the assassination of Lumumba, Cuban revolutionary Guevara traveled incognito to the Congo to put his guerrilla theories and tactics to work for the Congolese people. These brutally honest, unabridged journals illuminate a two-year period (1965-67) during which he trained left-wing soldiers fighting to wrestle the Congo from the imperialists. Trained as a physician and a member of Fidel Castro's government, Guevara understood the limitations that life imposes on humans and the sacrifices demanded in guerrilla warfare. Here he shares his experiences in Congolese training camps, chronicles the challenge (and ultimate failure) of spreading Cuban political ideology, and sheds light on his relationships with fellow revolutionaries, including a young Laurent Kabila and Fidel Castro. An honest, detailed account of the life and work of a great 20th-century revolutionary, this work completes Guevara's life story.

In particular this conversation often focuses on the two fastest-growing demographic groups in the United States: Asian Americans and Latinos. In <i>Academic Profiling</i>, Gilda L. Ochoa addresses this so-called gap by going directly to the source. At one California public high school where the controversy is lived every day, Ochoa turns to the students, teachers, and parents to learn about the very real disparities--in opportunity, status, treatment, and assumptions--that lead to more than just gaps in achievement.<br><br>In candid and at times heart-wrenching detail, the students tell stories of encouragement and neglect on their paths to graduation. Separated by unequal middle schools and curriculum tracking, they are divided by race, class, and gender. While those channeled into an International Baccalaureate Program boast about Socratic classes and stress-release sessions, students left out of such programs commonly describe uninspired teaching and inaccessible counseling. Students unequally labeled encounter differential policing and assumptions based on their abilities--disparities compounded by the growth in the private tutoring industry that favors the already economically privileged.<br><br>Despite the entrenched inequality in today's schools, <i>Academic Profiling</i> finds hope in the many ways students and teachers are affirming identities, creating alternative spaces, and fostering critical consciousness. When Ochoa shares the results of her research with the high school, we see the new possibilities--and limits--of change.</p><p><br>Gilda L.

They told tales of giants in the hills, dragons in the lakes, marshes swarming with will-o&#x2019;-the-wisps, and demons and wild folk in the mountains who enjoyed causing landslides, avalanches, and floods. They both feared and respected these entities, knowing the importance of appeasing them for safe travel and a prosperous homestead. <br> <br>Exploring medieval stories, folk traditions, spiritual place names, and pagan rituals of home building and site selection, Claude Lecouteux reveals the multitude of spirits and entities that once inhabited the land before modern civilization repressed them into desert solitude, impenetrable forests, and inaccessible mountains. He explains how, to our ancestors, enclosing a space was a sacred act. Specific rites had to be performed to negotiate with the local spirits and ensure proper placement and protection of a new building. These land spirits often became the household spirit, taking up residence in a new building in exchange for permission to build on their territory. Lecouteux explores Arthurian legends, folk tales, and mythology for evidence of the untamed spirits of the wilderness, such as giants, dragons, and demons, and examines the rites and ceremonies used to gain their good will. <br> <br>Lecouteux reveals how, despite outright Church suppression, belief in these spirits carried through to modern times and was a primary influence on architecture, an influence still visible in today&#x2019;s buildings. The author also shows how our ancestors&#x2019; concern for respecting nature is increasingly relevant in today&#x2019;s world.</p><p>Claude Lecouteux is a former professor of medieval literature and civilization at the Sorbonne.

Readers--who are assumed to have no prior computer programming or LabVIEW background--will begin writing meaningful programs in the first few pages. <br><b>Improvements to the Third Edition: </b>This new edition includes the following improvements:<br> * All chapters are fully updated to the latest version of LabVIEW. DAQ hardware now commonly used in instructional laboratories and self-learning is highlighted.<br> <br>* For easy reference, seven chapters begin with a "Basics" section that explains the fundamental operation of the LabVIEW function covered in that chapter [Chapters 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 12].<br> <br>* A new first chapter offers focused introduction to the LabVIEW programming environment. Readers construct a simple program to detect whether a given integer is even or odd [Chapter 1].&nbsp;<br><br>* Coverage of LabVIEW's text-based functions is given for both the MathScript Node and Formula Node [Chapter 4 and Appendix A].<br> <br>* Shift register usage is illustrated through a signal-averaging program (replacing the numerical integration and differentiation programs used in previous editions) [Chapter 7].<br> <br>* State machine program architecture is now taught in the case structure chapter (replacing the numerical integration program used in previous editions). Readers construct a state-machine guessing game and a digital oscilloscope with runtime control [Chapter 8].<br> <br>* A nonlinear curve fitting example is included in the text [Chapter 10].<br> <br>* The fast Fourier transform chapter opens with an Express VI-based "Quick Example" section, which gives a concise introduction to the digital spectral analysis topics of leakage and windowing. High-level mathematical coverage of these topics is moved to an appendix [Chapter 11 and Appendix B].<br> <br>* The proportional-integral-derivative temperature control project is now given in an appendix [Appendix C].<br> <br>* About 20 new end-of-the-chapter problems appear throughout the book.<br> <br>More information about this book can be found here:<br> <br>reed.edu/physics/faculty/essick/labview.html<br><br>global.oup.com/academic/product/hands-on-introduction-to-labview-for-scientists-and-engineers-9780190211899?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;#</p><p><b> TABLE OF CONTENTS</b><b></b> Each chapter ends with "Do It Yourself" and "Problems" sections.<br><i>Preface</i><br><b>1.

The story is rich in characters typical to Dickens, such as Mrs Jarley, Quilp, Dick Swiveller and the Marchioness.</p><p>The sound of Little Nell clattering hurriedly over cobblestones immediately sets the stage by bringing to mind the narrow and dangerous streets of Victorian London. No fewer than 20 performers are called upon to conjure up the Dickensian world of wanderers, ne'er-do-wells, con artists, and kind Samaritans--and each performance is excellent. Tom Courtenay plays the sadistic Quilp, "the ugliest dwarf that could be seen anywhere for a penny" with magnificent sarcastic glee, and Teresa Gallagher's silvery, childlike voice is ideally suited for the role of the angelic Little Nell.<p> Nell is on her way home to the dusty shop where she and her grandfather live a rather mysterious life. The old man disappears every night--visiting gambling dens with the naive hope of winning a fortune. Instead he sinks deeper and deeper into debt. Enter Daniel Quilp, moneylender, who becomes furious upon learning that the grandfather is a pauper and will never be able to repay his tremendous debt. Quilp seizes the curiosity shop and begins making lecherous overtures to Nell, so she and her grandfather steal away one morning to seek their fortunes elsewhere. But the demonic dwarf is never far behind.</p><p> Sound effects are employed judiciously and serve mainly as a springboard for the listener's imagination. The sound of a crying baby is enough to convey the image of crowded lodgings and genteel Victorian poverty, while raucous laughter and high-pitched squawks evoke the barely controlled chaos of an outdoor Punch and Judy show. The dramatization pares Dickens's weighty novel down to two and one-half hours, but does so skillfully, retaining Dickens's wit, marvelous dialogue, and delightful characterizations.

He has been hailed as the true literary heir to Lautr�amont and Arthur Rimbaud, and his &#x201c;inhuman&#x201d; works have been mentioned in the same breath as those by Georges Bataille and Antonin Artaud.</p><p>Winner of the 2006 prix D�cembre,<i> Coma</i> is the deeply moving, vivid portrayal of the artistic and spiritual crisis that wracked Guyotat in the 1980s when he reached the physical limits of his search for a new language, entered a mental clinic, and fell into a coma brought on by self-imposed starvation. A poetic, cruelly lucid account, <i>Coma</i> links Guyotat's illness and loss of subjectivity to a broader concern for the slow, progressive regeneration of humanity. Written in what the author himself has called a &#x201c;normalized writing,&#x201d; this book visits a lifetime of moments that have in common the force of amazement, brilliance, and a flash of life. Grounded in experiences from the author's childhood and his family's role in the French Resistance, <i>Coma</i> is a tale of initiation that provides an invaluable key to interpreting Guyotat's work, past and future.</p></p><p>Pierre Guyotat (born in 1940) has been a source of French literary scandal since the 1967 publication of <i>Tomb for 500,000 Soldiers.</i> The French government banned his novel <i>Eden Eden Eden</i> from being publicized, advertised on posters, or sold to anyone under the age of 18 from the time of its publication in 1970 until 1981.<p>For all it is a text of deterioration, of plowing into a coma through over-work, over-art, and over-language-creation, it is also a text of great sensitivity to the world and to humanity. It's an urgent, necessary publication that speaks, loader than anything else, the import of writing, and the implications of artistic engagement. These implications are dangerous, and so inescapably, so palpably, real.<i> Coma</i> is a generous gift: Guyotat's writing is literally stunning but it's not stunted, and never stunting.</p>&#x2015;<i>3:AM Magazine</i></p><h2>Life-Enriching Education: Nonviolent Communication Helps Schools Improve Performance, Reduce Conflict, and Enhance Relationships</h2><p>When Students Love to Learn and Teachers Love to Teach<br><br>In this revolutionary book, Marshall Rosenberg empowers educators to transform schools into life-serving, learning-rich environments that maximize the potential of each student. <br><br>Filled with insight, adaptable exercises and role-plays, <i>Life-Enriching Education</i> gives educators practical skills to generate mutually respectful classroom relationships.

After more than half a century of suspicion and interrogation, beauty's resurgence in visual practice and discourse since the late 1980s has engaged some of the most influential artists and writers on art. From the avant-garde to the conceptual era, anti-aesthetic strategies have resisted beauty because of its perceived complicity with dominant systems and ideologies. Thus politicized and opened to critique, beauty, invoked in relation to contemporary art, no longer sustains a singular or universal meaning but is always contentious. Spanning a range of positions on beauty&#x2015;both for and against&#x2015;this anthology assembles the key texts on the controversy and situates the debate over the revival of beauty in the broader context of the history of ideas and artistic practice.

It is thus political in the true sense because we can bring about changes in our perception of beauty. If, back in 1993, Dave Hickey resurrected the idea of beauty in art from the critical &#39;dead zone&#39; into which it had been consigned, then with this anthology Beech has not only revivified the debate about the politics of beauty but he has brought it up to date.&#34;--Patricia Bickers, Editor, &#34;Art Monthly, &#34; and Principal Lecturer, History and Theory of Art, University of Westminster, London</p><h2>The Sibyl</h2><p>"A parable, rather than a novel in the ordinary sense of the term,&nbsp;<i>The Sibyl</i>&nbsp;is . . . a work of manifold meanings and unmistakable profundity, one that can neither be easily understood nor easily forgotten." &#x2014;Granville Hicks,&nbsp;<i>The New Leader</i></p><p><p><strong>Par Lagerkvist </strong>(1891-1974), the author of some thirty-five books, was celebrated in his time for his versatility as a poet, dramatist, essayist, and novelist.

(It should not be confused with the sometimes non-benign phenomenon of computer hacking.) Noteworthy MIT hacks over the years include the legendary Harvard&#x2013;Yale Football Game Hack (when a weather balloon emblazoned &#x201c;MIT&#x201d; popped out of the ground near the 50-yard line), the campus police car found perched on the Great Dome, the apparent disappearance of the Institute president's office, and a faux cathedral (complete with stained glass windows, organ, and wedding ceremony) in a lobby. Hacks are by their nature ephemeral, although they live on in the memory of both perpetrators and spectators. <i>Nightwork</i>, drawing on the MIT Museum's unique collection of hack-related photographs and other materials, describes and documents the best of MIT's hacks and hacking culture. This generously illustrated updated edition has added coverage of such recent hacks as the cross-country abduction of rival Caltech's cannon (a prank requiring months of planning, intricate choreography, and last-minute improvisation), a fire truck on the Dome that marked the fifth anniversary of 9/11, and numerous pokes at the celebrated Frank Gehry-designed Stata Center, and even a working solar-powered Red Line subway car on the Great Dome. Hacks have been said to express the essence of MIT, providing, as alumnus Andre DeHon observes, "an opportunity to demonstrate creativity and know-how in mastering the physical world."

Basil becomes immediately infatuated with Dorian, who is cultured, wealthy, and remarkably beautiful. Such beauty, Basil believes, is responsible for a new mode of art, and he decides to paint a portrait of the young man. While finishing the painting, Basil reluctantly introduces Dorian to his friend Lord Henry Wotton, a man known for scandal and exuberance. Wotton inspires Dorian to live life through the senses, to feel beauty in everyday experience. Dorian becomes enthralled by Wotton&#x2019;s ideas, and more so becomes obsessed with remaining young and beautiful. He expresses a desire to sell his soul and have the portrait of him age, while he, the man, stays eternally young. A tragic story of hedonism and desire, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray </i>is Oscar Wilde&#x2019;s only published novel. Other writings include <i>De Profundis</i> and <i>The Ballad of Reading Gaol</i>. <br> <br>Enriched Classics enhance your engagement by introducing and explaining the historical and cultural significance of the work, the author&#x2019;s personal history, and what impact this book had on subsequent scholarship. Each book includes discussion questions that help clarify and reinforce major themes and reading recommendations for further research.<br> <br>Read with confidence.</p><p>A lush, cautionary tale of a life of vileness and deception or a loving portrait of the aesthetic impulse run rampant? Why not both? After Basil Hallward paints a beautiful, young man's portrait, his subject's frivolous wish that the picture change and he remain the same comes true. Dorian Gray's picture grows aged and corrupt while he continues to appear fresh and innocent. After he kills a young woman, "as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife," Dorian Gray is surprised to find no difference in his vision or surroundings. "The roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as happily in my garden." <p> As Hallward tries to make sense of his creation, his epigram-happy friend Lord Henry Wotton encourages Dorian in his sensual quest with any number of Wildean paradoxes, including the delightful "When we are happy we are always good, but when we are good we are not always happy." But despite its many languorous pleasures, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is an imperfect work. Compared to the two (voyeuristic) older men, Dorian is a bore, and his search for ever new sensations far less fun than the novel's drawing-room discussions. Even more oddly, the moral message of the novel contradicts many of Wilde's supposed aims, not least "no artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style." Nonetheless, the glamour boy gets his just deserts. And Wilde, defending Dorian Gray, had it both ways: "All excess, as well as all renunciation, brings its own punishment."</p>Oscar Wilde's only published full length novel, is the story of a man who sells his soul for eternal youth. In exchange, what does he give up and what does he gain? This novel, by Wilde is a wonderful soul-searching example of the cost of paradise, and the price of a wish. <p>Read by actor, comedian, novelist, journalist, screenwriter Stephen Fry, Dorian Gray's dilemma comes alive. He has also acted in a variety of films including A Fish Called Wanda, Peter's Friends, and The Wind in the Willows.</p></p><h2>Theory Practice Prof Effectiveness</h2><p>"This book is a landmark in two fields.

He challenges each ofus to accept full responsibility for carrying out God's work. Heshows us a way." --Reid S. Thebault President and CEO YMCA ofMetropolitan Detroit</p><p>Faith-Based Management Faith-based organizations differ radically from other not-for-profits. Balancing the tasks of managing staff, working with volunteers, providing services or spiritual assistance, and raising funds is a difficult and often frustrating endeavor. Faith-based organizations also have to operate in the secular world of funding, regulations, marketing, competition, and cash flow. All of these demands can tax even the best managers. Yet amazingly, until now, there were no professional resources geared exclusively to the concerns of leaders and managers of faith-based organizations. The first and only guide of its kind, Faith-Based Management arms you with the knowledge and skills you need to successfully manage your place of worship or faith-based service organization. Drawing upon his many years of experience as a trainer and consultant who has worked with hundreds of organizations nationwide, Peter Brinckerhoff explores the unique demands and common pitfalls that beset faith-based managers. Writing in a congenial, highly accessible style, he identifies the seven major characteristics shared by all successful faith-based organizations and shows you how to assess the strengths and weaknesses of your organization&#x2019;s management in each category. Using numerous real-world case studies and examples to illustrate his points, he describes proven faith-based management strategies and techniques that you can put to work immediately in your organization. And he provides clear-cut, easy-to-follow guidelines on how to manage for excellence in all crucial areas, including staff recruitment and management, financial stewardship, leadership, marketing, strategic planning, and more. Faith-Based Management is an indispensable hands-on resource for leaders, board members, managers of places of worship, faith-based service organizations, and faith-centered foundations.PETER C.

Her writing has appeared in the New York Times and the Psychology Today blog, among others. She lives in New York.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Stephen Lowman Seven hundred years ago, a Spanish doctor named Arnold of Villanova wanted to make a baby. He put semen in a womb-shaped vase and waited. The result was disappointing. We can shake our heads at the naivete of believing sperm contains teeny-tiny human beings just needing the proper place to grow. But physician and medical journalist Randi Hutter Epstein is here to tell us in "Get Me Out," her engrossing survey of the history of childbirth, that even with all of today's whiz-bang technology, "we are still in the dark about so many things that go into making babies." Writing that pregnancy has always been "a wonderful blend of custom and science," Epstein takes us on a delightful romp through past guides that are filled with a whole lot of do-this-but-avoid-that advice. "You've got to be kidding me" will be the reaction to most of it. For instance, on the recommendation of one folk healer, 16th-century French queen Catherine de Medici drank mare's urine and soaked in cow manure in order to get pregnant. The history of childbirth is filled with grief as well as joy, and not all the stories amuse. I shuddered at the descriptions of medieval C-sections, American slaves used as gynecological guinea pigs and the horrific effects of synthetic estrogen given to pregnant women in high doses from the late 1930s to the early '70s. Later, the author raises questions about the moral, legal and medical consequences of the growing -- and little-regulated -- fertility industry.

He inflamed my imagination. Writing about him, in truth, was a way for me to get to know him better. I didn't realize it, but it was also a way for me to get to know God better.... Francis became my guide, showing <br>me the way. (from a <i>Pilgrimage Diary<i>)<br><br><i>The Sun and Moon Over Assisi</i> reveals how the lives of the two medieval saints from Assisi--Francis and Clare--helped to transform the life of a thoroughly modern cynic from Los Angeles, California. The major events <br>of the lives of the two saints are unfolded here in a series of vivid and <br>engaging stories. Alongside the history of Francis and Clare, another <br>story unfolds: the story of the spiritual transformation of the author, Hollywood filmmaker and television producer Gerard Straub, illustrating how Francis and Clare still speak to the present-day, secularized person. The author takes the reader with him, in a series of pilgrimage diaries and reflections, to the beautiful Italian sites important to the two saints. With Straub, we traverse the charming Umbrian hill towns, including Assisi, tour its churches and examine the art of Giotto found there. <i>The Sun and Moon Over Assisi<i> tells of an interior pilgrimage that will inspire the modern reader.</i></i></i></i></p><p>The unlikely pilgrim in this highly recommended story is Gerard Thomas Straub, a former television producer who worked on popular soap operas such as "General Hospital" and "The Doctors." Raised as a Catholic, Straub fell into a bout of atheism after a disillusioning stint working for one of television's leading Christian evangelists. Nonetheless, Straub was blessed (or is it cursed?) with a seeker's soul and a novelist's imagination. He couldn't stay away from the quest for spiritual understanding. The upshot is a story within a story: the story of two saints from Assisi, Francis and Clare, as well as the story of how a disillusioned man finds himself in the Umbrian hills of Italy, completely entranced by these two legendary Italians. <p> If you enter this book as you would a meditation, you'll be fine. If you're looking for a light, straightforward narrative, move on. One must be willing to stop fidgeting and let go of expectations of how a memoir or a biography of a saint should read. Instead, this is a wandering and unfolding book that reveals deeper layers with every turn of page. Not only does it unveil the stories of Francis and Clare, it also reveals the classic human quest, where we face our most vulnerable spiritual questions and fears. Billed as an introduction to Franciscan scholarship, this is really more beautiful and ambitious. Consider it a primer on the art of Christian pilgrimage. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>GERARD THOMAS STRAUB is the author of the critically acclaimed <i>The Sun and Moon Over Assisi: A Personal Encounter with Francis and Clare<i> (St. Anthony Messenger Press), a book of reflections on the two saints of Assisi that earned the 2001 Catholic Press Association first place award for Spirituality Hardcover books and was named one of <i>Spirituality &amp; Health<i> magazine s Best Spiritual Books of 2001. Mr. Straub is also the author of <i>Dear Kate<i>, a novel, and <i>Salvation for Sale<i>, a nonfictional look at the world of televangelism.<br><br>Mr. Straub has had a long and distinguished career as a television producer and director. He produced, wrote and directed <i>We Have a Table for Four Ready<i>, a documentary film on the St. Francis Inn, a soup kitchen in the slums of Philadelphia operated by Franciscan friars, and <i>Room Enough for Joy<i>, a documentary film that tells the story of L Arche community in Tacoma, Washington. Mr. Straub also directed <i>Glidepath to Recovery<i>, a documentary film that showcases the work of a diocesan priest in Albany, New York, who works with drug addicts and ex-convicts. The three films have aired on many PBS stations. Mr. Straub has also produced numerous television shows for CBS, NBC and ABC, including the wildly popular soap opera <i>General Hospital<i>. <br><br>Mr. Straub annually teaches a month-long course on film writing and directing at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.

Is the text real? Are these the authentic words of Jesus? If they are, what does it all mean? This new translation is surrounded by supportive material to help scholars and students alike explore these sayings in depth. Unlike other translations, Lynn Bauman&#x2019;s sensitive work is not simply a literal&#x201d; translation. Based upon the principle of dynamic equivalency,&#x201d; its purpose is to propel the reader/listener into an equivalent experience of language and meaning as the original Coptic text but in English, with equivalent cultural terms and ideas. It is therefore fresher, more poignant, more direct, and more understandable without being a paraphrase. In addition, the text has with it a reader&#x2019;s guide. Each saying of Jesus is accompanied by a section that includes Questions for Reflection, an academic translation of each saying, and notes dealing with translation choices. This enables the reader to make discoveries on his or her own through suggestions and questions for consideration, meditation, and journaling.</p><p>Lynn Bauman is director of the Praxis Retreat and Learning Center in Telephone, Texas. He is a lecturer in Comparative Religion, Islamic Philosophy, Near Eastern Studies, Christian and World Spirituality. He lived for 10 years in the Middle East, including 7 years in Iran, where he studied Sufism and Islamic spirituality with Seyyed Hossein Nasr.The Gospel of Thomas has been the hot extrabiblical text this year, judging from the best seller status of Elaine Pagels's Beyond Belief and strong sales for translations and interpretations of this once-lost collection of Jesus' more Gnostic sayings. To this we add Lynn Bauman's The Gospel of Thomas: Wisdom of the Twin, which aims to be less a literal translation of the Coptic than an experiential encounter with Jesus as a teacher of wisdom. Each of Jesus' logia, or sayings, is accompanied by explanatory notes and questions for reflection. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>65 Short Mysteries You Solve with Math!

Bout's vast enterprise of guns, planes, and money has fueled internecine slaughter in Africa and aided both militant Islamic fanatics in Afghanistan and the American military in Iraq.</p><p>This fast-paced and terrifying true story reveals that, as the world celebrated the end of the Cold War, Bout emerged from a murky post-Soviet intelligence background and quietly amassed a huge fleet of aging Russian cargo planes. His intelligence contacts, aircraft, and access to sophisticated weapons helped him forge lethal alliances across the Third World. Before long, he sat atop an immense and complex empire: a relentless international war machine able to deliver anything from AK-47s and missile launchers to artillery and attack helicopters, along with millions of rounds of ammunition, to anyone willing to pay. And pay they did, in Rwanda and the Congo, in Liberia and Sierra Leone, in Sudan and Afghanistan, and many stops in between.</p><p>Merchant of Death also reveals that, despite the efforts of a small circle of U.S. officials and international investigators who worked doggedly to shut down Bout's arms pipelines, the West has done little to dismantle this incredible transnational empire. In fact, far from attacking this provider of essential support to despots, insurgents, and terrorists around the world, the United States paid him millions of dollars to fly weapons and supplies to the U.S. military and private contractors in Iraq.</p><p>Authors Douglas Farah and Stephen Braun detail how, through his own ingenuity and a staggering lack of resolve in the international community, Bout has successfully skirted every attempt to undo his enterprise and flourishes, while the world's premier intelligence services have largely given up the chase. The only question that remains is how will his unparalleled career end? With his arrest, or his retirement to a lavish, guarded estate in some remote African nation? </p><p>Compelling and timely, Merchant of Death combines the technical precision of a Tom Clancy epic with the insights and ironies of a John LeCarr� novel to tell a thrilling and appalling real-life tale of relentless greed, devastating warfare, and breathtaking international intrigue.</p><b>Douglas Farah</b> is the former West African bureau chief of the Washington Post, and the author of Blood from Stones: The Secret Financial Network of Terror.<p><b>Stephen Braun</b> is a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning national correspondent for the Los Angeles Times.</p></p><h2>Indonesian: A Comprehensive Grammar: A Comprehensive Grammar (Routledge Comprehensive Grammars)</h2><p><p>This grammar is a complete reference guide to the language of Indonesia as used by native speakers.</p> <p>The book is organised to promote a thorough understanding of Indonesian grammar.

It reveals the sinister forces that, towards the end of his life, Twain thought to be threatening the American dream. The central plot revolves around the tragedy of "Roxy," a mulatto slave whose attempt to save her son from his fate succeeds only in destroying him. An astringent work which raises the serious issue of racial difference, <em>Pudd'nhead Wilson</em> is considered by the critic F.R. Leavis to be "a classic of the use of popular modes--the sensational and the melodramatic."

Mowat is dropped alone onto the frozen tundra, where he begins his mission to live among the howling wolf packs and study their waves. Contact with his quarry comes quickly, and Mowat discovers not a den of marauding killers but a courageous family of skillful providers and devoted protectors of their young. As Mowat comes closer to the wolf world, he comes to fear with them on onslaught of bounty hunters and government exterminators out to erase the noble wolf community from the Arctic. <i>Never Cry Wolf</i> is one of the brilliant narratives on the myth and magical world of wild wolves and man's true place among the creatures of nature. "We have doomed the wolf not for what it is, but for what we deliberately and mistakenly perceive it to be -- the mythological epitome of a savage, ruthless killer -- which is, in reality, no more than the reflected image of ourself." -- from the new preface to <i>Never Cry Wolf</i>.<b>Farley Mowat</b> was born in Belleville, Ontario, in 1921, and grew up in Belleville, Trenton, Windsor, Saskatoon, Toronto, and Richmond Hill.

In his circle are artists, musicians, writers, performers, as well as friends from his ten years as a psychiatric technician. It is the artist's empathetic eye that allows him to imagine his figures with authenticity and grace--not better than they are, or more glamorous--but part of a big, complicated world.

In this astonishingly rich biography, Isaac mines this remarkable document--and many other sources--to reconstruct Carter's interior world as it plunged into revolution. <br> The aging patriarch, though a fierce supporter of American liberty, was deeply troubled by the rebellion and its threat to established order. His diary, originally a record of plantation business, began to fill with angry stories of revolt in his own little kingdom. Carter writes at white heat, his words sputtering from his pen as he documents the terrible rupture that the Revolution meant to him. Indeed, Carter felt in his heart that he was chronicling a world in decline, the passing of the order that his revered father had bequeathed to him. Not only had Landon's king betrayed his subjects, but Landon's own household betrayed him: his son showed insolent defiance, his daughter Judith eloped with a forbidden suitor, all of his slaves conspired constantly, and eight of them made an armed exodus to freedom. The seismic upheaval he helped to start had crumbled the foundations of Carter's own home.<br> In <em>Landon Carter's Uneasy Kingdom</em> Rhys Isaac unfolds not only the life, but also the mental world of our countrymen in a long-distant time. Moreover, in this presentation of Landon Carter's passionate narratives, the diarist becomes an arresting new character in the world's literature, a figure of Shakespearean proportions, the Lear of his own tragic kingdom. This long-awaited work will be seen both as a major contribution to Revolution history and a triumph of the art of biography.<br></p><p><br><strong>Rhys Isaac</strong> is Distinguished Visiting Professor at the College of William and Mary and a Research Associate of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1983 for <em>The Transformation of Virginia, 1740-1790</em>.<br>In the tiny world of colonial Virginia, Landon Carter was a very big cheese. He was the patriarch of one of Virginia's oldest, wealthiest and most prominent families -- First Families of Virginia through and through, right up there with the Byrds, the Berkeleys, the Fitzhughs, the Lees and the Lightfoots -- and the owner of an immense estate. Not merely did he preside over the plantation called Sabine Hall, about 50 miles north of Williamsburg, with its "total enslaved population of around 100," but he "also owned more distant plantations . . . in further parts of Richmond County, in Northumberland County down-river, in Fauquier, Stafford and Prince William, and Loudoun Counties up-river, and in York, and King and Queen Counties to the southward," a thralldom in which some 400 additional slaves labored.<p>By the standards of his time, place and class, Carter probably was a good man. He was a son of the Enlightenment who read extensively and was intimate with the classics. Something of an amateur physician, he tended assiduously to the medical needs of all those who came under his sway. He married three times -- all three wives died -- and was the father of seven children. As a young man he "began the typical career of a high-born Virginia gentleman," serving as "a justice of the peace in the county court, a colonel of the county militia, and a parish vestryman of the tax-supported Church of England, and he continued in these offices until revolution disrupted the whole system." Like many other colonial grandees, he was devoutly loyal to the crown and maintained stout allegiance to it right up to enactment of the Stamp Act in 1765. Thereafter he was a strong (if somewhat befuddled) supporter of the revolution and the new order it brought, though at his death in December 1778 its full implications remained unknown.</p><p>He was also a devoted, if not outright obsessive, diarist, from 1758 until his death. "Landon Carter's long-kept record is truly remarkable among diaries," Rhys Isaac writes. "The imprint of its angry keeper is so intense, and his outrage resonates with the deep family drama embedded in one of the most momentous revolutions in the history of the world. Through all his experiences he gives us an unequaled view of a man, like many of his contemporaries, divided within himself. He clung to his British constitutional heritage, but his heart was given to the cause of American liberty."</p><p>Isaac, visiting professor at the College of William and Mary and author of The Transformation of Virginia, 1740-1790, uses Carter's diaries as the foundation upon which to build Landon Carter's Uneasy Kingdom. He quotes from them extensively within his own narrative (he identifies them by setting them in italics) toward achieving his two-fold purpose: "to open for readers an understanding of Landon Carter's world as he knew it" and "to show the Revolution as personal experience." Like so many others who have inhabited American academia since the late 1960s, Isaac is under the spell of the race-gender-class mantra and thus is susceptible to interpreting the past through the lens of the present, but the reader who is willing to overlook his occasional attitudinizing will find that in collaboration with Landon Carter he has created a detailed, persuasive picture of a world so different from our own as to be almost unimaginable.</p><p>Isaac's biases show most clearly in his emphasis on that buzzword of radical feminism, "patriarchy." Right at the outset he posits Carter's "self-idealization as lord and patriarch," and he beats that drum incessantly thereafter. In this instance, though, he is on firm ground. Colonial America was a patriarchy, just as was the England it took as model, and it was nowhere more so than in the South, where patriarchal sway extended beyond the boundaries of natural family to those wholly involuntary members of the extended family, the slaves:</p><p>"Landon, according to his worldview, knew that he had a patriarchal duty to all on his estate. Care &amp; protection was what the feudal lord owed his dependent inferiors. In return, of course, they owed him service, deference, and obedience. This was very much how Landon saw his relationship to his enslaved workers. It was congruent with his own sacred obligation to his own sometimes-harsh, sometimes-benign master, God. . . . Landon knew that he had divine authority to keep idlers at their tasks. He knew he had a duty to punish as necessary the sinful children of Eve who were in his charge."</p><p>The sinful included not just his slaves, but his own children. His eldest son, Robert Wormsley Carter, lived at Sabine Hall with his wife, Winifred, whom it is no exaggeration to say Landon Carter loathed -- in the diaries she is portrayed as "the outspoken contrary woman," and Carter records "the sad, the infuriating and the humiliating intimacies" of her life -- and treated accordingly. His daughter Judith married over his vehement opposition and was repudiated for a long time before an eventual reconciliation. Carter entered all his complaints in his diary, then left it where family members could read its "passionate narratives" and, presumably, bathe in their own guilt. "These dramas are conflicts such as every family harbors to this day," Isaac writes; "but they are also historic since they carry reverberations of the disturbed times through which the diarist felt himself fated to live."</p><p>It is difficult for us now to comprehend just how disturbed those times actually were. Well before the Revolution began, the known world was undergoing deep change. Carter was well acquainted with a new kind of novel -- Samuel Richardson's Clarissa and Pamela -- that "told strong stories of [women's] self-realization and so contributed subtly but surely to the subversion of the ancient hierarchical order of ruling fathers." Carter, Isaac argues, was torn between "sentimental" and "authoritarian" stories: "he wanted to be a lordly patriarch like his father; and he wanted to be loved and understood like Pamela or Clarissa."</p><p>Carter's world was falling apart, and Isaac makes a rather strong case that he knew it. As Isaac writes (in the clotted prose that can make reading this book a mighty labor), "In the political sphere, expectations of government shifted away from kingly patriarchalism toward the more comprehensively participatory modes that would generate the ideology of democracy." Carter's diaries in his final years "come from a late moment of an ancient regime of knowledge and society. The diarist felt in his heart that he was chronicling decline. His own death could not be far off, and he sensed also the passing of the world which his altogether admirable father had bequeathed to him."</p><p>Nothing hastened the end of that world so emphatically and conclusively as the American Revolution. After the Stamp Act, Carter knew, as Benjamin Franklin did, that he could not be a free man under British rule, and he turned from royalist to revolutionary, just as Franklin did. "It is very hard now . . . to realize the radicalism of this step," Isaac writes, "and so to understand not only the agony that Landon felt, deep-dyed patriarchal monarchist that he was, but also the kind of collective anguish of the colonists, long so proudly British." The reader might wish for more graceful prose, but Isaac is right when he says: "Casting out the king and founding the republic was a patricidal act; and the father killing was cosmic. It profoundly changed the order of the world. The principle of patriarchy within the institution of monarchy had been comprehensive; it had given coherence to the whole system."</p><p>That a better system replaced it is self-evident, but this made it no easier for those who had to undergo the metamorphosis. The autumn of these patriarchs was wrenching and painful. It is perhaps easier to pass judgment on them than to understand them, but Isaac manages to accomplish the latter even as he indulges himself in the former. </p><p>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

Legitimacy was transmitted from master to disciple in a manner similar to that in religious traditions. Lippit illuminates the role of key factors--bequeathal of artworks, authentication of art, painting in the mode of famous masters, collections of art, and the use of art in governance--in establishing the orthodoxy of the Kano painters and their paramount role in defining Japanese painting.<br><br><i>The Painting of the Realm</i> is pathbreaking in its analysis of the discursive operations of the Kano school and its posing of large questions about painting that exceed narrow artist-centered, formalist analysis. Lippit has undertaken a bold and dense study of painting production and reception, presenting original and compelling interpretations.</p><p><b>Yukio Lippit </b>is Harris K.

It is also the complex evocation of the rebelling youth&#x2015;squatters, punks, artists and radicals, theorists and ex-terrorists&#x2015;who gathered all their energy and creativity in order to outlive a hostile environment. Like a time capsule, <i>The German Issue</i> brings together all the major &#x201c;issues&#x201d; that were being debated on both sides of the Atlantic&#x2015;which eventually found their abrupt resolution in 1989 with the fall of the Berlin Wall. It involved the most important voices of the period&#x2015;from writers and filmmakers to anthropologists, activists and poets, terrorists and philosophers: Joseph Beuys, Michel Foucault, Christo, Christa Wolf, Walter Abish, Alexander Kluge, Paul Virilio, Ulrilke Meinhof, William Burroughs, Jean Baudrillard, Hans Magnus Enzenberger, Maurice Blanchot, Hans J�rgen Syberberg, Heidegger, Andr� Gorz, Helke Sander. Opening with Christo's &#x201c;Wrapping Up of Germany&#x201d; and the celebrated dialogue between East German dramaturge Heiner M�ller and Sylv�re Lotringer on the Wall (&#x201c;Mauer&#x201d;), since published in many languages, <i>The German Issue</i> offers a first-hand account of the Western world on the threshold of a major global mutation. It also embodies at its best Semiotext(e)'s tenacious effort to establish a creative bridge between art and intellect, culture and politics, Europe and America.</p></p><p>Sylv�re Lotringer is Jean Baudrillard Chair at the European Graduate School, Switzerland, and Professor Emeritus of French literature and philosophy at Columbia University.</p><h2>Cooperative Games and Sports, Joyful Activities for Everyone (Second Edition)</h2><p><p>Children live what they learn through games and play.

What the study of census data, the study of one person at a time, monitoring today&#39;s events, or reconstruction of social life centuries ago all have in common is that regardless of their case material, they construct representations of social life through a dialogue of ideas (theory) and evidence (data). To illustrate, Ragin points out the important continuities in three major forms of social research: qualitative study of commonalities; comparative research on diversity; and quantitative research on relationships among variables.</p><p><p><strong>Charles C. Ragin</strong> spent most of his youth in Texas and the southeastern United States. He attended the University of Texas at Austin as an undergraduate and received his BA degree in 1972 at the age of 19. That same year he began graduate work in sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and received his PhD in 1975. From 1975 until 2001, he lived in the Midwest, teaching first at Indiana University and then at Northwestern University. He headed west in 2001, where he spent just over a decade at University of Arizona-Tucson. In 2012, he joined the faculty at the University of California-Irvine, where he is currently the Chancellor&#x2032;s Professor of Sociology. He is best known for developing a methodological alternative to conventional research methods, using formal set-theoretic techniques for comparative research. His many publications address broad issues in politics and society, with topics ranging from the causes of ethnic political mobilization to the shaping of the welfare state in advanced capitalist countries. He has written several books including <em>Intersectional Inequality: Race, Class, Test Scores and Poverty</em> (with Peer Fiss, 2017). <em>Redesigning Social Inquiry: Fuzzy Sets and Beyond</em> (2008) <em>Fuzzy-Set Social Science</em> (2000). His book <em>The Comparative Method: Moving Beyond Qualitative and Quantitative Strategies</em> (1987) won the 1989 Stein Rokkan Prize of the International Social Science Council of UNESCO. In 2014 he received the Paul F. Lazarsfeld Award of the American Sociological Association.

Italian political thinker Paolo Virno argues that the category of "multitude," elaborated by Spinoza and for the most part left fallow since the seventeenth century, is a far better tool to analyze contemporary issues than the Hobbesian concept of "people," favored by classical political philosophy. Hobbes, who detested the notion of multitude, defined it as shunning political unity, resisting authority, and never entering into lasting agreements. "When they rebel against the state," Hobbes wrote, "the citizens are the multitude against the people." But the multitude isn't just a negative notion, it is a rich concept that allows us to examine anew plural experiences and forms of nonrepresentative democracy. Drawing from philosophy of language, political economics, and ethics, Virno shows that being foreign, "not-feeling-at-home-anywhere," is a condition that forces the multitude to place its trust in the intellect. In conclusion, Virno suggests that the metamorphosis of the social systems in the West during the last twenty years is leading to a paradoxical "Communism of the Capital."</p></p><p>Paolo Virno is an Italian philosopher, semiologist, and a prominent figure among the Italian Postfordist thinkers. He currently teaches at the University of Rome and is the author of <i>A Grammar of the Multitude </i>and <i>Multitude Between Innovation</i> and Negation, both published in English by Semiotext(e).</p><h2>Exodus (Interpretation Bible Studies)</h2><p><p>Weaving together the stories of Moses, the nation of Israel, and the God who rescues and liberates, Exodus becomes a story for our time, a story about seeking and finding a redeeming God in times of separation and sin, hopelessness and oppression.</p><p>Interpretation Bible Studies (IBS) offers solid biblical content in a creative study format.

Terra now lies within the Warmaster&#x2019;s sights, the Throneworld and the seat of his father&#x2019;s rule. Horus&#x2019; desire is nothing less than the death of the Emperor of Mankind and the utter subjugation of the Imperium. He has become the ascendant vessel of Chaos, and amassed a terrible army with which to enact his will and vengeance. But the way to the Throne will be hard as the primarch Rogal Dorn, the Praetorian and protector of Terra, marshals the defences. First and foremost, Horus must challenge the might of the Sol System itself and the many fleets and bulwarks arrayed there. To gain even a foothold on Terran soil, he must first contend the Solar War. Thus the first stage of the greatest conflict in the history of all mankind begins.</p><p>John French is the author of several Horus Heresy stories including the novels The Solar War, Praetorian of Dorn, Tallarn and Slaves to Darkness, the novella The Crimson Fist, and the audio dramas Dark Compliance, Templar and Warmaster. For Warhammer 40,000 he has written Resurrection and Incarnation for The Horusian Wars and three tie-in audio dramas&nbsp;&#x2013; the Scribe award-winning Agent of the Throne: Blood and Lies, as well as Agent of the Throne: Truth and Dreams and Agent of the Throne: Ashes and Oaths. John has also written the Ahriman series and many short stories.&nbsp;</p><h2>Utopia: Thomas More</h2><p>First published in 1516, Saint Thomas More's Utopia is one of the most important works of European humanism. Through the voice of the mysterious traveler Raphael Hythloday, More describes a pagan, communist city-state governed by reason. Addressing such issues as religious pluralism, women's rights, state-sponsored education, colonialism, and justified warfare, Utopia seems remarkably contemporary nearly five centuries after it was written, and it remains a foundational text in philosophy and political theory. <p>Preeminent More scholar Clarence H. Miller does justice to the full range of More's rhetoric in this new translation. Professor Miller includes a helpful introduction that outlines some of the important problems and issues that Utopia raises, and also provides informative commentary to assist the reader throughout this challenging and rewarding exploration of the meaning of political community.</p></p><p><i>The Life of Thomas More</i> is Peter Ackroyd's biography--from baptism to beheading--of the lawyer who became a saint. More, a noted humanist whose friendship with Erasmus and authorship of <i>Utopia</i> earned him great fame in Europe, succeeded Cardinal Wolsey as Lord Chancellor of London at the time of the English Reformation. In 1535, More was martyred for his refusal to support Henry VIII's divorce and break with Rome. Ackroyd's biography is a masterpiece in several senses. Perhaps most importantly, he corrects the mistaken impression that Robert Bolt's <i>A Man for All Seasons</i> has given two generations of theater and film audiences: More was not, as Bolt's drama would have us believe, a civil disobedient who put his conscience above the law. Ackroyd explains that "conscience was not for More an individual matter." Instead, it was derived from "the laws of God and of reason." If the greatest justice in this book is analytic, however, its greatest joys are descriptive. Ackroyd brings 16th-century London to life for his readers--an exotic world where all of life is enveloped by the church: "As the young More made his way along the lanes and thoroughfares, there was the continual sound of bells." --<i>Michael Joseph Gross</i>Thomas More&#39;s Utopia is one of the supreme achievements of Renaissance humanism. His complex and ironic account of an imaginary communist society has not only given rise to the genre of utopian fiction but has been an inspiration to generations of political reformers.</p><h2>The Comfort Women: Sexual Violence and Postcolonial Memory in Korea and Japan (Worlds of Desire: The Chicago Series on Sexuality, Gender, and Culture)</h2><p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In an era marked by atrocities perpetrated on a grand scale, the tragedy of the so-called comfort women&#x2014;mostly Korean women forced into prostitution by the Japanese army&#x2014;endures as one of the darkest events of World War II. These women have usually been labeled victims of a war crime, a simplistic view that makes it easy to pin blame on the policies of imperial Japan and therefore easier to consign the episode to a war-torn past. In this revelatory study, C. Sarah Soh provocatively disputes this master narrative.<br> Soh reveals that the forces of Japanese colonialism and Korean patriarchy together shaped the fate of Korean comfort women&#x2014;a double bind made strikingly apparent in the cases of women cast into sexual slavery after fleeing abuse at home. Other victims were press-ganged into prostitution, sometimes with the help of Korean procurers. Drawing on historical research and interviews with survivors, Soh tells the stories of these women from girlhood through their subjugation and beyond to their efforts to overcome the traumas of their past. Finally, Soh examines the array of factors&#x2014; from South Korean nationalist politics to the aims of the international women&#x2019;s human rights movement&#x2014;that have contributed to the incomplete view of the tragedy that still dominates today.</p> <p></p> <p></p></p><p><b>C. Sarah Soh</b> is professor of anthropology at San Francisco State University and the author of<i>Women in Korean Politics</i>.<p>&#x201c;This is a courageous, judicious, and well-written book that refuses to yield to knee-jerk responses or politically correct narratives, but rather insists on setting the comfort women within broader historical and cultural contexts. Sympathetic and sensitive, C. Sarah Soh nevertheless challenges both feminist and ethnic nationalist paradigms in an astonishing display of objectivity. <i>The Comfort Women</i> is a lucid, brave, and important work.&#x201d;</p> (Gail Lee Bernstein, author of Isami&#x2019;s House: Three Centuries of a Japanese Family)<br><br>"C. Sarah Soh&#x2019;s study of &#x2018;comfort women&#x2019; offers a close-grained yet compassionate analysis of this disturbing experience. She cogently deploys ethnography and history to illuminate a crucial case in gender and international issues.&#x201d; (James L. Peacock, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill)<br><br>&#x201c;This is a dispassionate, careful, well-researched, and brave book. Embedding her story in the whole history of prostitution and abusive treatment of women from the colonial period to the present, Soh shows that the comfort women system partook not just of the authoritarian politics of Japanese colonialism, but was also deeply rooted in a Korean patriarchy whose effects continued on after 1945. I expect this book will be the standard work on the subject for some time.&#x201d; (Bruce Cumings, University of Chicago)<br><br>"A brave and impressive book that usefully complicates and adds layers to our understanding of a sordid system." (Jeff Kingston <i>Japan Times</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Since 1991, when Korean comfort women first stepped forward to demand compensation, much has been written about the Japanese military comfort system. Through careful anthropological work, Soh adds to knowledge about this system and provides a nuanced context within which to understand it. . . . In this courageous book, Soh succeeds in her aspiration to write against both adversarial ethnonationalisms and ahistorical international feminisms.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)</p><h2>Gramatica lengua espanola: Reglas y ejercicios (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Indispensable at school, at work, or in the home, this one-stop Spanish grammar guide includes examples and exercises that address every common grammar question.

Bringing the cataclysmic clash of ideas and personalities to colorful life, Hellman explores both the science and the spirit of the times. Along the way, he reveals that scientific feuds are fueled not only by the purest of intellectual disagreements, but also by intransigence, ambition, jealousy, politics, faith, and the irresistible human urge to be right.<br>Unusual insight into the development of science . . .

It is the <i>process</i> that is the living science; that's what makes the activity exciting to those who practice it," science writer Hal Hellman observes. "Often, however, the process of scientific discovery is charged with emotion.... Holders of an earlier idea may not give it up gladly." Hellman describes some of the most emotional, dramatic, and personal debates in scientific history. He rounds up the usual suspects--Galileo versus the pope, Newton versus Leibniz, Cope versus Marsh, evolution versus Creation--but also includes less well known, but no less interesting, conflicts: Wallis versus Hobbes on squaring the circle, Voltaire versus Needham on embryos. And he boldly includes two conflicts in which (some) of the combatants are still alive: Don Johanson versus the Leakeys on human origins and Derek Freeman versus the ghost of Margaret Mead on Samoa. Never a dull moment. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i>The dramatic stories of historic feuds in science and how they altered the course of discovery and helped to shape the modern world. Some of the biggest breakthroughs in science have caused battles that have raged over decades, even centuries. Great Feuds in Science tells the fascinating stories of 14 of the most heated disputes in the history of science, from the 17th through the 20th centuries. It introduces readers to the major players and the times they lived in, explains the scientific principles involved, and shows how such controversies are not only typical, but often necessary to the progress of science.</p><h2>Winning His Spurs: A Tale of the Crusades</h2><p>Winning His Spurs: A Tale of the Crusades By George Alfred Henty</p><p></p><h2>Stone Shelters</h2><p>Numerous photographs, scaled maps, and drawings trace the development of this vernacular architecture from the Stone Age to the present.</p><p>"This handsome book about vernacular architecture first attracts your eye, then engages your mind.

Montgomery&#x2019;s classic novel is as memorable as its heroine.</b><br><br>When Anne Shirley arrives at Green Gables, she surprises everyone: first of all, she&#x2019;s a girl, even though Marilla Cuthbert and her brother Matthew specifically asked for an orphan boy to help around the farm. And second of all, she&#x2019;s not just any girl: she has bright red hair, a wild imagination, and can talk a mile a minute.<br> <br>But she also has a sweet disposition and quick wit, and Anne (with an &#x201c;e&#x201d; of course&#x2014;it&#x2019;s so much more distinguished!) soon finds her place in Avonlea, making a friend in her neighbor Diana Barry and attending the local school, where she spurns the advances of the popular and handsome Gilbert Blythe when he commits the ultimate sin of making fun of her hair.<br> <br>Anne has a temper as fiery as her hair and a knack for finding trouble, and she also has a big heart and a positive attitude that affects everyone she meets. This classic and beloved story makes a wonderful gift and keepsake.</p><p>When Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables, Prince Edward Island, send for a boy orphan to help them out at the farm, they are in no way prepared for the error that will change their lives. The mistake takes the shape of Anne Shirley, a redheaded 11-year-old girl who can talk anyone under the table. Fortunately, her sunny nature and quirky imagination quickly win over her reluctant foster parents. Anne's feisty spirit soon draws many friends--and much trouble--her way. Not a day goes by without some melodramatic new episode in the tragicomedy of her life. Early on, Anne declares her eternal antipathy for Gilbert Blythe, a classmate who commits the ultimate sin of mocking her hair color. Later, she accidentally dyes that same cursed hair green. Another time, in her haste to impress a new neighbor, she bakes a cake with liniment instead of vanilla. Lucy Maud Montgomery's series of books about Anne have remained classics since the early 20th century. Her portrayal of this feminine yet independent spirit has given generations of girls a strong female role model, while offering a taste of another, milder time in history. This lovely boxed gift collection comprises <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>, <i>Anne of the Island</i>, <i>Anne of Avonlea</i>, <i>Anne of Windy Poplars</i>, <i>Anne's House of Dreams</i>, <i>Anne of Ingleside</i>, <i>Rainbow Valley</i>, and <i>Rilla of Ingleside</i>.

Instead, Nicholas Roe reveals the real flesh-and-blood poet: a passionate man driven by ambition but prey to doubt, suspicion, and jealousy; sure of his vocation while bitterly resentful of the obstacles that blighted his career; devoured by sexual desire and frustration; and in thrall to alcohol and opium. Through unparalleled original research, Roe arrives at a fascinating reassessment of Keats&#39;s entire life, from his early years at Keats&#39;s Livery Stables through his harrowing battle with tuberculosis and death at age 25. Zeroing in on crucial turning points, Roe finds in the locations of Keats&#39;s poems new keys to the nature of his imaginative quest.Roe is the first biographer to provide a full and fresh account of Keats&#39;s childhood in the City of London and how it shaped the would-be poet. The mysterious early death of Keats&#39;</p><p><b>Nicholas Roe </b>is professor of English, University of St. Andrews. He is the author of numerous biographical and critical works on writers of the Romantic period. He lives in Scotland."A wonderful work that has many new things to say about Keats, his extraordinary work and inner life.

Meticulously researched and precisely visualised, it produces a kind of hypnotic video portrait of Keats, day-by-day and sometimes hour-by-hour. The fine evocation of the poet&#x2019;s disturbed City childhood is brilliantly fed back into the complex imagery of the later poetry. Above all perhaps, Roe&#x2019;s deep knowledge of Keats&#x2019;s wide and raffish circle of London friends &#x2013; Hunt, Haydon, Brown, Hazlitt, Lamb, Reynolds, Severn and all the others &#x2013; makes us see the poet from multiple angles, in all his fierce contradictions, so sympathetic and so strangely modern.' - Richard Holmes, author of <i>The Age of Wonder: How the Romantic Generation Discovered the Beauty and Terror of Science</i> (Richard Holmes)<br><br>"This new&nbsp;book&nbsp;promises to become&nbsp;the definitive biography of one of the major&nbsp;Romantic poets.

Keats has of course been well served by biographers, but what Roe adds to these Lives is his own superbly detailed, finely discriminating understanding of and research into the events of Keats's life, of individuals in his family and wider circle, and of the larger historical contexts in which the poet lived and wrote. The result is a book that supplements in countless minor details what is already known about the poet.

Conclusions are perpetually delayed. Resolutions are continually postponed. The text is written for takeoff, not arrival. It is a first step for readers' explorations of current modes of art making and for their own future artistic achievements. The much-anticipated follow-up to <i>Art on the Edge... and Over</i>, Linda Weintraub's highly accessible introduction to contemporary art since the 1970s, <i>In the Making: Creative Options for Contemporary Art</i> explores essential but sometimes elusive facets of art making today. In her trademark writing style--straightforward and jargon-free--Weintraub sets out to itemize the conceptual and practical concerns that go into making contemporary art in all its endless permutations. In six clearly defined thematic sections--&#x201d;Scoping an Audience,&#x201d; &#x201c;Sourcing Inspiration,&#x201d; &#x201c;Crafting an Artistic 'Self',&#x201d; &#x201c;Expressing an Artistic Attitude,&#x201d; &#x201c;Choosing a Mission,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Measuring Success&#x201d;--Weintraub moves artist by artist, in 40 individual chapters, using each to explain a different aspect of art making. Isaac Julien makes work for a highly specific audience; Michal Rovner communicates through metaphor and symbol; Charles Ray disrupts the viewer's assumptions; Pipilotti Rist is inspired by female emotions; William Kentridge is moved by apartheid and redemption; Vanessa Beecroft epitomizes the biography of a smart, attractive, Caucasian woman; and Matthew Barney achieves success through resistance. Through a compelling combination of renowned and up-and-coming artists, Weintraub creates a complex understanding of how to make and look at contemporary art--but in a simple, easily digestible format and language.<br><br>In addition to being a fine read for anyone who simply wants to understand how to look at contemporary art, <i>In the Making</i> is also an exceptional pedagogical tool, one that addresses what is fast becoming a huge gap in art education. Teaching artistic techniques no longer provides young artists with a sufficient education--a full range of conceptual issues needs to be considered in any well-rounded studio practice.

Remaining faithful to the series&#39; active approach it treats the play as a script to be acted, explored and enjoyed. As well as the complete script of the play, you will find a variety of classroom-tested activities, an eight-page colour section and a selection of notes including information on characters, performance, history and language.</p><p>Are you frustrated by obscure words and unidiomatic phrases in Shakespeare's plays? The new "Access to Shakespeare" series removes the mystery, not the magic, from MACBETH, and makes reading or studying a breeze. This translation of MACBETH into contemporary English -- alongside the original text -- has modernized the difficult passages and expressions which used to make Shakespeare's language such heavy weather. <p>This unique translation is NOT a literal-minded prose version. It retains the feel and the rhythm of the original, letting you experience the play in the same enjoyable way an Elizabethan audience did. The text is immediately clear to today's readers, making those tedious footnotes unnecessary. You'll find easy-to-follow line numbering, and a glossary of place names and mythological references. </p><p>Are you a high school or junior-college student working on an assignment? Do you wish to preview the play before a performance, or are you perhaps learning English as a Second Language? This translation is ideal for you. You will never again hesitate to read THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH because you're mystified by such lines as, "... keep my bosom franchised." The facing page of this edition of MACBETH makes clear what Shakespeare meant, "... keep my conscience free." </p><p>The translation reads like a modern book and it's fascinating.</p>[back cover]<br><b>Picture This!<br>Shakespeare </b><br>William Shakespeare&#x2019;s<br><b>Macbeth </b><br>They can tempt him.<br>They can promise him anything,<br>but the witches cannot do his killing for him.<br>To get what he wants he will have to murder,<br>again and again . . .<br><b>Picture This!

It is written for your students. Its purpose is to teach physical chemistry, as opposed to covering the subject. To cover is not to teach. Pursuant to this objective, the narrative is often informal and relaxed. The material is presented using the same language I might employ if a student were to come to my office asking for help. Indeed, it is my intent that, as students read and study Principles of Physical Chemistry, they will feel that I am sitting across the table, providing one-on-one tutorial instruction. The discussion of all of the topics appearing in the text is sufficiently detailed to give the students a reasonable chance of becoming quantitatively competent in the area. </p><p> The underlying philosophy of the book is that teaching is a joint enterprise between instructor and author, with a common objective: to bring the students to a functional level of literacy in the use, practice, appreciation, and execution of physical chemistry principles and methods. It is my opinion that this task is extremely difficult&#x2014;so much so that it cannot be achieved if we bring only half of our weapons to bear. A brilliant textbook coupled with an instructor who devotes little effort to the task of teaching will, at best, produce only poor results. A superb instructor who gives outstanding lectures will also fail to reach many of the students if the textbook he or she uses comprises only pictures, final equations with hand-waving explanations, simplistic examples, and "plug-and-chug" problems that are little more than practice on a calculator. This same superb instructor will also fail to achieve the best possible result if the students cannot or will not read the text. The problem is that once the brilliant lecture is completed, it is gone forever. When the students sit down to study, they have only their incomplete notes that are necessarily flawed because they couldn't listen, understand, and write fast enough to produce accurate notes, and the instructor couldn't speak or write fast enough to cover all the critical points. They need a textbook that makes the same determined effort to teach as the superb instructor does during a lecture and in his or her office in tutorial sessions with the students. </p><p> I have done everything my ability permits to produce such a textbook. The derivations of virtually all equations are given in complete detail. All algebraic steps are shown and explanations inserted to help the student understand and learn the derivations, and I take pains to point out where key assumptions or simplifications are made. Figures, diagrams, and drawings are employed when they facilitate learning. They are, however, never used in place of a rigorous presentation of the material. Qualitative explanations and analogies to events that are familiar to the students are frequently used, but both are always backed by a quantitative treatment of the subject. The text assumes that the students have had a one-year university-level course in differential and integral calculus, but the critical mathematical methods are always developed and explained in detail before their use. These presentations are incorporated into the body of the text itself. The text tams 243 fully solved examples that are generally at the same level as the problems at the end of the chapter. The solutions to all 815 end-of-chapter problems are given in the Instructor's Guide (ISBN 0-13-026671-X). These solutions are as detailed as the textbook examples, with all steps shown (A student's solutions manual, with answers to only half the problems, is also available; ISBN 0-13040664-3). An explanation for each step is inserted, and appropriate comments about the importance of the problem are presented. In addition, the Instructor's Guide contains 351 suggested examination questions that can, if desired, be used as additional homework exercises. All chapters conclude with a summary of the key points and equations. Humor is used without apology. </p><p> The use of this textbook gives the instructor great latitude in deciding what to present during the time available in lecture. Since all derivations are given in complete detail, lecture time can be used to work additional examples or to emphasize the key points in the development of the equations. Alternative derivations or additional material can be presented, or question-and-answer sessions with the students can emphasize important concepts. Because the instructor need not "write a textbook on the blackboard," there is considerable flexibility in organizing the lecture material. </p><p> My own experience in using prepublication versions of Principles of Physical Chemistry suggests that the best option is to present the lecture material as if the textbook did not exist. This means that during the lecture I go over material that is already in the text. I have found that this repetition helps the students a great deal. It is much easier for students to understand the spoken word when combined with body language, voice cadence and inflection, and blackboard derivations than it is to glean the material from a written textbook. When this is done, the material in the book becomes much easier to read and understand. In addition, the text now provides excellent "notes" for study that are accurate and complete and that present good examples at the same level as the problems assigned by the instructor. </p><p> It is my sincere hope that you find Principles of Physical Chemistry helpful in your efforts to bring your students to a truly functional level of knowledge of, and ability to do, physical chemistry. I extend my apologies for any remaining errors or inaccuracies in the text and would appreciate being informed about them. I invite each of you to submit your favorite problems for publication in the second edition. Full credit will be given at the point the problems appear in the text. Details for submission are given in the Instructor's Guide. Suggestions on any and all points are welcome. INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDENT </p><p> This textbook was written for you. You will find the narrative style informal and relaxed, with frequent use of the first person. Humor is used without apology. It is my intent that as you read and study the text, you will feel that I am sitting across the table, providing one-on-one tutorial instruction. </p><p> The text assumes that you have had the equivalent of a one-year university-level course in differential and integral calculus. However, the critical mathematical methods are always developed and explained in detail before their use. These presentations are incorporated into the body of the text, rather then being relegated to an appendix. Two hundred forty-three detailed examples are given, and all steps in their solution are presented and explained. Furthermore, they are generally at the same level as the end-of-chapter problems and thus will be very helpful in your efforts to learn how to work the problems and gain an understanding of physical chemistry in the process. </p><p> Let us now turn to the question that is probably uppermost in your mind: "Can I pass this course with a decent grade and learn something in the process?" The answer is "Yes, if you work and study regularly, diligently, and in the right manner." Since the vast majority of you are juniors, seniors, or graduate students, you are already aware that science and engineering courses require a great deal of effort. This comes as no surprise; the real key is in the last prepositional phrase in the preceding sentence: "in the right manner." Each time I teach physical chemistry, a minimum of a half-dozen students come to my office in academic difficulty and say, "I don't know what's wrong. I understand the material very well when you present it in class or when you work examples on the board, but I don't seem to be able to do the problems when I'm taking an examination." The number of times I've heard this statement is well into the hundreds&#x2014;perhaps as high as a thousand. These are students who are working hard. They want to learn. They want to make a good grade, but things are not working well for them, and they do not understand why that is happening. This is the situation you want to avoid. You know that if you don't work, you will not do well in physical chemistry or any other of life's difficult endeavors. If you do invest the time and effort, however, you have a right to expect reasonably good results, and I would like to try to help you obtain them. </p><p> Let me put the problem these students are having in a different perspective with a simple analogy. For years, I have been a fan of the NBA Chicago Bulls, which is to say Michael Jordan and Company. I have watched them play many, many times on television. I have Jordan's moves memorized: He stands at the top of the key and takes the pass from Pippen. One of the most superb players in the league is assigned to guard this incomparable master of the game. Jordan fakes to his right, then dribbles to his left. The player guarding him is not fooled. He has seen the move many times. He follows Jordan step for step, cuttin</p><p> <b>LIONEL M. RAFF</b> is Regents Professor of Chemistry at Oklahoma State University.

Engineering principles required for each multiple access strategy are presented parallel to it. <b> </b> For electrical engineers and others involved in wireless communications. </p></p><p><p> The rapid growth of wireless communications and its pervasive use are changing the way we communicate in some fundamental ways. <i>Modern Wireless Communications</i> distinguishes itself with the treatment of these techniques in depth and yet in a principled manner that can be taught at the undergraduate level. The order in which these techniques are treated follows the evolution of spectral utilization of the radio channel. As a consequence, much of the material in the book is presented in the order in which it was actually developed, giving students insight into the logic and need for each development. </p> <b>Features of the Book</b> <p> Each chapter includes: </p><ul> <li>Examples with detailed solutions</li> <li>Problems that help the reader develop an improved understanding of the issues, along with the answers</li> <li>End-of-chapter problems that provide an abundance of additional examples, whose solutions will further help the reader develop a deeper understanding of the material covered</li> <li>Notes and References that guide the reader to related sources for further reading.</li> <li>Theme Examples, which discuss pertinent issues of practical relevance.</li> </ul> <p> <i>Modern Wireless Communications</i> is indispensable both in a course on wireless communications or as a useful reference for practicing electrical engineers. </p><p> The rapid growth of wireless communications and its pervasive use in all walks of life are changing the way we communicate in some fundamental ways. Most important, reliance on radio propagation as the physical mechanism responsible for the transport of information-bearing signals from the transmitter to the receiver has endowed communications with a distinctive feature, namely, mobility. </p> <p> <i>Modern Wireless Communications</i> is a new book aimed at the teaching of a course that could follow a traditional course on communication systems, as an integral part of an undergraduate program in electrical engineering or as the first graduate course on wireless communications. The primary focus of the book is on the physical layer, emphasizing the fundamentals of radio propagation and communication-theoretic aspects of multiple-access techniques. Many aspects of wireless communications are covered in an introductory level and book form for the first time. </p> <p><b>1. ORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK</b></p> <p> The book is organized in seven chapters, nine appendices, and a bibliography. </p> <p> Chapter 1 motivates the study of wireless communications. It begins with a brief historical account of wireless communications, and then goes on to describe the OSI model of communication networks. The discussion, however, focuses on the issues that arise in the study of the physical layer, which is the mainstay of the book. </p> <p> Chapter 2 on radio propagation starts with an explanation of the physical mechanisms of the propagation process, including free-space propagation, reflection, and diffraction. These physical mechanisms provide insight into the statistical models that are employed for terrestrial and indoor propagation effects that follow. The small-scale effects of fading and uncorrelated scattering are discussed, leading up to a careful classification of the different wireless channel types. The second half of the chapter describes noise and interference, and how combined with propagation, we may determine wireless communication system performance through a link-budget analysis. </p> <p> Chapter 3 reviews the modulation process with emphasis on digital transmission techniques. This introductory treatment of modulation paves the way for discussions of the following issues: </p> <ul> <li>Complex baseband representation of linear modulated signals, and the corresponding input/output descriptions of linear wireless communication channels and linear band-pass filters.</li> <li>� Practical problems concerning adjacent channel interference and nonlinearities in transmit power amplifiers.</li> </ul> <p> The stage is then set for comparative evaluation of various modulation strategies for wireless communications, discussion of receiver performance in the presence of channel noise and Rayleigh fading, and discussion of frequency-division multiple-access (FDMA). </p> <p> Chapter 4 focuses on coding techniques and time-division multiple-access (TDMA). After a brief review of Shannon's classical information theory, the source coding of speech signals is discussed, which is then followed by fundamental aspects of convolutional codes, interleavers, and turbo codes. The relative merits of convolutional codes and turbo codes are discussed in the context of wireless communications. The various aspects of channel-estimation, tracking, and channel equalization are treated in detail. The discussion then moves onto TDMA and the advantages it offers over FDMA. </p> <p> Chapter 5 discusses spread spectrum, code-division multiple-access (CDMA), and cellular systems. It first presents the basics of spread-spectrum systems, namely, direct-sequence, and frequency-hopped systems, and their tolerance to interference. A fundamental component of spread-spectrum systems is the spreading code: a section of the chapter is devoted to explaining Walsh-Hadamard, maximal-length sequences, Gold codes, and random sequences. This discussion is then followed with a description of RAKE receivers, channel estimation, code synchronization, and the multipath performance of direct-sequence systems. This leads naturally to a discussion of how direct-sequence systems perform in a cellular environment. </p> <p> Chapter 6 is devoted to the notion of space diversity and related topics. It starts with diversity on receive, which represents the traditional technique for mitigating the fading problem that plagues wireless communications. Then the chapter introduces the powerful notion of multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communications, which includes space diversity on receive and space diversity on transmit as special cases. Most important, the use of MIMO communications represents the "spatial frontier" of wireless communications in that, for prescribed communication resources in the form of fixed transmit power and channel bandwidth, it provides the practical means for significant increases in the spectral efficiency of wireless communications at the expense of increased computational complexity. The discussion of MIMO wireless communications also includes orthogonal space-time block codes (STBC), best exemplified by the Alamouti code and its differential form. The discussion then moves onto space-division multiple access (SDMA), and smart antennas. </p> <p> Chapter 7 links the physical layer and multiple-access topics of the previous chapters with the higher layers of the communications network. This final chapter of the book begins with a comparison of the different multiple-access strategies. The discussion then leads to a consideration of various link-management functions associated with wireless systems, namely, signaling, power control, and handover. The differences between systems used for telephony and those used for data transmission are clearly delineated. This is then followed by a discussion of wireless network architectures, both for telephony and data applications. </p> <p><b>1.1 Theme Examples</b></p> <p> An enriching feature of the book is the inclusion of Theme Examples within each of the chapters in the book, except for Chapter 1. In a loose sense, they may be viewed as "Chapters within Chapters" that show the practical applications of the topics discussed in the pertinent chapters. Specifically, the following Theme Examples are discussed: </p> <p> Chapter 2: Empirical propagation model, wireless local area networks (LANs), and impulse radio and ultra-wideband </p> <p> Chapter 4: Global system for mobile (GSM) communications, joint equalization and decoding, and random-access techniques </p> <p> Chapter 5: Code-division multiple access (CDMA) Standard IS-95, GPSS, bluetooth, wideband CDMA and WiFi </p> <p> Chapter 6: BLAST architectures, diversity, space-time block codes, and V-BLAST, and keyhole channels </p> <p> Chapter 7: Wireless telephone network standards, wireless data network standards, and IEEE 801.11 MAC </p> <p><b>1.2 Appendices</b></p> <p> To provide supplementary material for the book, nine appendices are included: </p> <ul> <li>Fourier theory</li> <li>Bessel functions</li> <li>Random variables and random processes</li> <li>Matched filters</li> <li>Error function</li> <li>Maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) decoding</li> <li>Capacity of MIMO links</li> <li>Eigendecomposition</li> <li>Adaptive antenna array</li> </ul> <p> The inclusion of these appendices is intended to make the book essentially self-sufficient. </p> <p><b>1.3 Other Features of the Book</b></p> <p> Each chapter includes "within-text" problems that are intended to help the reader develop an improved understanding of the issues being discussed in the text. "End-of-chapter" problems provide an abundance of additional problems, whose solutions will further help the reader develop a deeper understanding of the material covered in the pertinent chapter. </p> <p> Moreover, each chapter includes examples with detailed solutions covering different aspects of the subject matter. </p> <p> "Notes and References" included at the end of the chapter provide explanatory notes, and they guide the reader to related references for further reading. All the references so made are assembled in the Bibliography placed at the end of the book. </p></p><h2>Miracle Food Cures from the Bible</h2><p>An ever-growing body of scientific research demonstrates the importance of holistic treatments that focus on the mind-body connection for good health.

The news marks an important change that will have a far-reaching impact on world economies, investments, and business profitability.<p>In "A Thousand Barrels a Second," Chief Energy Economist of ARC Financial Peter Tertzakian delivers a provocative look at the future of oil and offers fresh insight into what it will take to rebalance our energy needs and seize new opportunities.</p><p>Tertzakian provides a unique analysis of shifts in energy trends, describing how past critical junctures -what he calls energy "break points"-developed, evolved, and shaped nations; changed consumer behavior; and launched or ruined businesses. With the world already consuming 85 million barrels of oil a day, Tertzakian answers the top questions that business leaders, policy makers, investors, and concerned citizens are asking him as we approach the coming break point: Are today's high oil and gas prices part of a routine business cycle, or are there more profound forces at play?

But when a string of exquisitely ritualistic murders begins plaguing the New York art scene, Kate finds herself drawn back into the dark world of her past.</p></p><p>Kate McKinnon, a former cop turned philanthropist, art impresario, and socialite, is a heroine straight out of a Judith Krantz novel, which is not necessarily a bad thing: you can always count the brand names Jonathan Santlofer drops on almost every page, even if you're not particularly intrigued by the mystery of who's behind a string of ritualistic serial murders that are carefully staged to resemble famous paintings only a woman with Kate's arcane knowledge and aesthetic judgment might recognize. Or you could figure out who's next on the killer's list faster than Kate manages to--she can't rule anyone out, not even her husband. Despite that rather silly red herring, she finally manages to get to the bottom of things in this stylish thriller from a painter whose fantasies of murder and revenge--on critics, collectors, competitors, and gallery owners, evidently--must have required a wider than usual canvas. <i>-- Jane Adams</i><p>Jonathan Santlofer is the author of five novels and a highly respected artist whose work has been written about and reviewed in the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Art in America</em>, <em>Artforum</em>, and <em>Arts</em>, and which appears in many public, private, and corporate collections.

This is his first book.Boston Globe reporter Farrell's biography of Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill (1912-1994) is much like the subject himself: large, rambling, sentimental and thoroughly fascinating. Farrell, a winner of a George Polk Award, traces O'Neill's career from its beginning in the 1930s in the rough-and-tumble world of Boston politics to his ascendancy to Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1977. O'Neill was often seen as a genial bear of a man, and Farrell shows that beneath this surface lay a complex personality built of equal parts insecurities and a sharp, pragmatic intellect. Yet O'Neill never wavered in his beliefs that "all politics is local" and that New Deal-style government programs could help the folks back in the district live better lives. O'Neill's career is, then, intertwined with the once basic Democratic ideal of activist government. Greatness came late in O'Neill's life, when as Speaker, he faced off against another genial Irish politician, Ronald Reagan. If Reagan sought to bring to a close the New Deal legacy, O'Neill sought to save it. And if the Reagan Revolution won, O'Neill, contends Farrell, softened its effects, made it less severe and more humane, and made himself a folk hero in the process. With wonderful detailDfrom describing ward politics in Boston to deal making in CongressDO'Neill's story is also the story of America in the past half-century, and the tale is thoroughly mesmerizing. Illus. not seen by PW. (Mar. 21) Forecast: While this tome is hefty, Farrell's highly accessible writing style and a continued fascination among the public with O'Neill should garner a large audience for this book, especially but not only in his home state of Massachusetts (the late congressman's 1987 memoir sold 360,000 copies). <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Thomas Moran</h2><p>This lavishly illustrated book - a survey of Moran's work throughout his career - presents nearly one hundred of his works, reproduced in color, along with essays by leading authorities that explore his virtuosity in various fields.<br>The book begins with four interpretive biographical essays by Nancy K. Anderson that introduce sections of color plates of works from the major periods in Moran's professional career. A fully illustrated chronology of Moran's life and work accompanies this presentation. Thomas P. Bruhn then discusses Moran's etchings, engravings, and lithographs, and Joni L. Kinsey describes Moran's career as an illustrator. The book also includes three appendices that reproduce, for the first time, a portfolio of fifteen views commissioned by the Prang Chromolithographic Company; Moran's "Opus List"; and a firsthand account of Moran's 1873 trip to the Grand Canyon, written by Justin E. Colburn, a New York Times correspondent.</p><p>Thomas Moran hiked through the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone in 1871, when most folks back East thought that stories of hundred-foot-high geysers, thousand-foot-deep canyons, and such were probably hogwash. After he submitted his glorious paintings of cliffs, rapids, and sun-struck vistas, Americans were finally persuaded that the West was as real as it was wild. It is largely because of Moran's glowing, oil-painted testimony that a formerly skeptical U.S. Congress soon preserved those spectacular lands. This book is the catalog of the 1998 retrospective of Moran's work, which opened on the 125th anniversary of the dedication of Yellowstone National Park. Anderson's essays cover every phase of Moran's life and career, from his work as an illustrator and printmaker to his success as one of the gentleman painters of New York City. It contains scores of archival photographs of the rather theatrical Moran as he aged, with his ever-lengthening, ever-whitening chin whiskers, and such treasures as a long letter he wrote from Yellowstone to his beautiful wife, Mary, in which he blithely describes rattlesnakes, tarantulas, and wolves observed at close range. The letter is signed "Your loving Hub." Along with Albert Bierstadt, Frederick Church, John Frederick Kensett, and other 19th-century landscape painters, viewers often associate Moran with what he called "a wonderful age," the optimistic years between the Civil War and the Great War. This book contains plates of every quintessentially American scene he painted--the pulsing sunset over the pristine wilderness, the windswept mountain pass, the misty, rushing stream. A scholarly book, it nonetheless captures much of the wonder Moran and his peers felt for the vast Western landscape and the glowing future it represented. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i>Moran's watercolors of the Yellowstone country so impressed Congress that it established the second U.S. national park in less than two months in 1872. Moran's subsequent monumental landscape, <i>The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone</i>, became one of the most famous paintings of the nineteenth century, and Moran enjoyed a prolific and successful career thereafter. Yet Anderson implies in this exceptional companion to the first retrospective exhibition of Moran's work that not enough about him is generally available. So she and her colleagues present a whopping amount of material--not just sterling reproductions on nonglossy stock that resists finger-smudging but a four-chapter resumeof Moran's life and career, notes to the colorplates that consist of nineteenth-century reactions to his work and the literary passages that inspired him, essays on his printmaking and publishing, a 96-page biochronology, and appendixes, including, complete, the portfolio of Yellowstone watercolors that wowed the public in 1876. Anderson hopes this catalog only begins a future, extensive Moran bibliography, but really, it is a library in itself. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>POETS &amp; MURDER</h2><p>Judge Dee, the master detective of seventh-century China, sets out to solve a puzzling double murder and discovers complex passions lurking beneath the placid surface of academic life.

Painstakingly detailed, impressively fair, the result is the most definitive account yet of a woman who captured the imagination of the American public like no First Lady before or after her. Bradford seems to have interviewed almost everyone who had ever been intimate with Onassis, including George Plimpton, Gore Vidal, Joan Kennedy, and even a few ex-lovers. Most notably of all, Jackie's sister Lee Radziwill speaks with unexpected frankness about the mixture of rivalry and affection that marked their relationship since childhood. Jackie-lovers, take note: this is no hagiography, and its subject certainly comes off as no saint. As gracious as this American icon could be, she also had moments of coldness and even greed, including a particularly shocking moment by the bedside of Ari Onassis's dying son. Yet, in the end, non-airbrushed anecdotes like these only serve to make this most private of public figures even more fascinating. Jackie was, as Bradford writes, "a complex woman of many facets, concealed insecurities and intricate defense mechanisms, a strong urge toward the limelight contrasting with a desire for privacy and concealment.... Behind the mask of beauty and fame lay a shrewd mind, a ruthless judgment of people, antennae finely turned to any sign of pretentiousness or pomposity, and a wry, even raunchy sense of humor." The figure who emerges from subsequent pages is as compelling as the heroine of any novel, and it is to Bradford's credit that she doesn't seem to have fallen completely under her subject's spell. Her approach is sympathetic, but never fawning; candid, but never sensationalistic. For those who are curious not about Jackie's glamour but about its source, <i>America's Queen</i> offers an unprecedented look at the flesh-and-blood woman behind the Camelot myth. <i>--Carlotta DeWitt</i>Sarah Bradford is a historian and biographer.

In confirmation of this evidence, recent data from unmanned spacecraft has led astronomers to actively search for what is being called "Planet X." <br><br>The subsequent volume, <i>The Stairway to Heaven</i>, traces man's unending search for immortality to a spaceport in the Sinai Peninsula and to the Giza pyramids, which had served as landing beacons for it--refuting the notion that these pyramids were built by human pharaohs. Recently, records by an eye witness to a forgery of an inscription by the pharaoh Khufu inside the Great Pyramid corroborated the book's conclusions. <br><br><i>The Wars of Gods and Men</i>, recounting events closer to our times, concludes that the Sinai spaceport was destroyed 4,000 years ago with nuclear weapons.

Yet, argues Slavoj &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek, it is only when we have admit to ourselves that our situation is completely hopeless - that the light at the end of the tunnel is in fact the headlight of a train approaching us from the opposite direction - that fundamental change can be brought about. Surveying the various challenges in the world today, from mass migration and geopolitical tensions to terrorism, the explosion of rightist populism and the emergence of new radical politics - all of which, in their own way, express the impasses of global capitalism - &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek explores whether there still remains the possibility for genuine change. Today, he proposes, the only true question is,or should be, this: do we endorse the predominant acceptance of capitalism as fact of human nature, or does today's capitalism contain strong enough antagonisms to prevent its infinite reproduction? Can we, he asks, move beyond the failure of socialism, and beyond the current wave of populist rage, and initiate radical change before the train hits?

She was known as the Queen of Regency romance, and was legendary for her research, historical accuracy, and her extraordinary plots and characterizations.</p><br><br>Mrs. Wetherby was delighted to receive a morning call from her only surviving brother, but for the first half hour of his visit she was granted no opportunity to do more than exchange a few commonplaces with him over the heads of her vociferous offspring.<br><br>Sir Gareth Ludlow had arrived in Mount Street just as the schoolroom party, comprising Miss Anna, a lively damsel within a year of her d�but, Miss Elizabeth, and Master Philip, were returning from a promenade in the park under the aegis of their governess. No sooner did these delicately nurtured children catch sight of their uncle's tall, elegant figure than they threw to the winds every precept of gentility, so carefully instilled into their heads by Miss Felbridge, and, with piercing shrieks of: "Uncle Gary, Uncle Gary!" raced helter-skelter down the street, to engulf Sir Gareth on their doorstep. By the time Miss Felbridge, clucking but indulgent, had overtaken them, the butler was holding open the door, and Sir Gareth was being borne into the house by his enthusiastic young relatives. He was being pelted with questions and confidences, his eldest niece hanging affectionately on one arm, and his youngest nephew trying to claim his attention by tugging violently at the other, but he disengaged himself for long enough to offer his hand to Miss Felbridge, saying with the smile which never failed to set her heart fluttering in her chaste bosom: "How do you do? Don't scold them! It is quite my fault&#x2014;though why I should have this shocking effect upon them I can't conceive! Are you quite well again? You were suffering all the discomfort of a bad attack of rheumatism when last we met."<br><br>Miss Felbridge blushed, thanked, and disclaimed, thinking that it was just like dear Sir Gareth to remember such an unimportant thing as the governess's rheumatism. Any further interchange was cut short by the arrival on the scene of Mr. Leigh Wetherby, who erupted from the library at the back of the house, exclaiming: "Is that Uncle Gary! Oh, by Jove, sir, I'm devilish glad to see you! There's something I particularly wish to ask you!"<br><br>The whole party then swept Sir Gareth upstairs to the drawing-room, all talking at the tops of their voices, and thus deaf to a halfhearted attempt on Miss Felbridge's part to restrain her charges from bursting in upon their mama in this very irregular fashion.<br><br>It would have been useless to have persisted, of course. The young Wetherbys, from Leigh, undergoing the rigours of coaching to enable him to embark upon a University career later in the year, to Philip, wrestling with pothooks and hangers, were unanimous in giving it as their considered opinion that nowhere was there to be found a more admirable uncle than Sir Gareth. An attempt to whisk the younger members off to the schoolroom could only have resulted in failure, or, at the best, in a fit of prolonged sulks.<br><br>In the well-chosen words of Mr. Leigh Wetherby, Sir Gareth was the most bang-up fellow that ever drew breath. A noted Corinthian, he was never too high in the instep to show a nephew aspiring to dandyism how to arrange his neckcloth. Master Jack Wetherby, unconcerned with such fopperies as this, spoke warmly of his open-handedness and entire comprehension of the more urgent needs of young gentlemen enduring the privations of life at Eton College. Miss Anna, by no means out yet, knew no greater source of joy and pride than to be taken up to sit beside him in his curricle for a turn or two round the Park, the envy (she was convinced) of every other, less favoured, damsel. As for Miss Elizabeth, and Master Philip, they regarded him as a fount of such dizzy delights as visits to Astley's Amphitheatre, or a Grand Display of Fireworks, and could perceive no fault in him.<br><br>They were not singular: very few people found fault with Gareth Ludlow. Watching him, as he contrived, while displaying over and over again for the edification of little Philip the magical properties of his repeating watch, to lend an ear to the particular problem exercising Leigh's mind, Mrs. Wetherby thought that you would be hard put to it to find a more attractive man, and wished, as she had done a thousand times before, that she could discover some bride for him lovely enough to drive out of his heart the memory of his dead love. Heaven knew that she had spared no pains during the seven years that had elapsed since Clarissa's death to accomplish this end. She had introduced to his notice any number of eligible females, several of them as witty as they were beautiful, but she had never been able to detect in his gray eyes so much as a flicker of the look that had warmed them when they had rested on Clarissa Lincombe.<br><br>These reflections were interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Wetherby, a dependable-looking man in the early forties, who grasped his brother-in-law's hand, saying briefly: "Ha, Gary! Glad to see you!" and lost no time in despatching his offspring about their several businesses. This done, he told his wife that she shouldn't encourage the brats to plague their uncle.<br><br>Sir Gareth, having regained possession of his watch and his quizzing-glass, slipped the one into his pocket, and hung the other round his neck by its long black riband, and said: "They don't plague me. I think I had better take Leigh along with me to Crawley Heath next month. A good mill will give him something other to think of than the set of his coats. No, I know you don't approve of prizefighting, Trixie, but you'll have the boy trying to join the dandy-set if you don't take care!"<br><br>"Nonsense! You don't wish to burden yourself with a scrubby schoolboy!" said Warren, imperfectly concealing his gratification at the invitation.<br><br>"Yes, I do: I like Leigh. You needn't fear I shall let him get into mischief: I won't."<br><br>Mrs. Wetherby broke in on this, giving utterance to the thought in her mind. "Oh, my dear Gary, if you knew how much I long to see you with a son of your own to indulge!"<br><br>He smiled at her. "Do you, Trixie? Well, as it chances, it is that subject which has brought me to see you today." He saw the look of startled consternation in her face, and burst out laughing. "No, no, I am not about to disclose to you the existence of a lusty love-child! Merely that I believe&#x2014;or rather, that I hope&#x2014;I may shortly be demanding your felicitations."<br><br>She was for a moment incredulous, and then cried eagerly: "Oh, Gary, is it Alice Stockwell?"<br><br>"Alice Stockwell?" he repeated, surprised. "The pretty child you have been throwing in my way? My dear! No!"<br><br>"Told you so," remarked Mr. Wetherby, with quiet satisfaction.<br><br>She could not help feeling a little disappointed, for Miss Stockwell had seemed to be of all her prot�g�es the most eligible. She concealed this very creditably, however, and said: "I declare I have not the least guess, then, who it may be. Unless&#x2014;oh, do, pray, tell me at once, Gary!"<br><br>"Why, yes!" he replied, amused at her eagerness. "I have asked Brancaster's leave to address myself to Lady Hester."<br><br>The effect of this announcement was somewhat disconcerting. Warren, in the act of taking a pinch of snuff, was surprised into sniffing far too violently, and fell into a fit of sneezing; and his lady, after staring at her brother as though she could not believe her ears, burst into tears, exclaiming: "Oh, Gary, <em>no!"</em><br><br>"Beatrix!" he said, between laughter and annoyance.<br><br>"Gareth, are you hoaxing me? Tell me it's a take-in! Yes, of course it is! You would never offer for Hester Theale!"<br><br>"But, Beatrix&#x2014;!" he expostulated. "Why should you hold Lady Hester in such aversion?"<br><br>"Aversion! Oh, no! But a girl&#x2014;<em>girl? </em>She must be nine-and-twenty if she's a day!&#x2014; A woman who has been on the shelf these nine years, and more, and never <em>took, </em>or had <em>countenance, </em>or the least degree of modishness&#x2014; You must be out of your senses! You must <em>know </em>you have only to throw the handkerchief&#x2014; Oh, dear, how could you do such a thing?"<br><br>At this point, her helpmate thought it time to intervene. Gareth was beginning to look vexed. A charming fellow, Gary, with as sweet a temper as any man alive, but it was not to be expected that he would bear with complaisance his sister's strictures on the lady whom he had chosen to be his bride. Why, from amongst all the females only too ready to receive the addresses of a handsome baronet of birth and fortune, he should have selected Hester Theale, who had retired after several unsuccessful seasons to make way for her more marriageable sisters, was certainly a baffling problem, but not one into which Warren thought it seemly to enquire. He therefore cast an admonitory look at his wife, and said: "Lady Hester! I am not particularly acquainted with her, but I believe her to be an unexceptionable young woman. Brancaster accepted your offer, of course."<br><br>"Accepted it?" said Beatrix, emerging from her handkerchief. "Jumped at it, you mean! I imagine he must have swooned from the shock!"<br><br>"I wish you will be quiet!" said Warren, exasperated by this intransigent behaviour. "Depend upon it, Gary knows what will suit him better than you can! He is not a schoolboy, but a man of five-and-thirty. No doubt Lady Hester will make him an amiable wife."<br><br>"No doubt!" retorted Beatrix. "Amiable, and a dead bore! No, Warren, I will not hush! When I think of all the pretty and lovely girls who have done their best to attach him, and he tells me that he has offered for an insipid female who has neither fortune nor an extraordinary degree of beauty, besides being stupidly shy and dowdy, I&#x2014; oh, I could go into strong hysterics!"<br><br>"Well, if you do, Trixie, I give you fair warning that I shall empty over you the largest jug of water I can find!" responded her brother with unimpaired cordiality. "Now, don't be such a goose, my dear! You are putting poor Warren to the blush."<br><br>She sprang up, and grasped the lapels of his exquisitely cut coat of blue superfine, giving him a shake, and looking up into his smiling eyes with the tears still drowning her own. "Gary, you do not love her, nor she you! I have never seen the least sign that she regards you even with partiality. Only tell me what she has to offer you!"<br><br>His hands came up to cover hers, removing them from his lapels, and holding them in a strong clasp. "I love you dearly, Trixie, but I can't permit you to crumple this coat, you know. Weston made it for me: one of his triumphs, don't you think?" He hesitated, seeing that she was not to be diverted; and then said, slightly pressing her hands: "Don't you understand? I had thought that you would. You have told me so many times that it is my duty to marry&#x2014;and, indeed, I know it is, if the name is not to die with me, which I think would be a pity. If Arthur were alive&#x2014;but since Salamanca I've known that I can't continue all my days in single bliss. So&#x2014;!"<br><br>"Yes, yes, but why <em>this </em>female, Gary?" she demanded. "She has nothing!"<br><br>"On the contrary, she has breeding, and good manners, and, as Warren has said, an amiable disposition. I hope I have as much to offer her, and I wish that I had more. But I have not."<br><br>The tears sprang to her eyes again, and spilled over. "Oh, my dearest brother, <em>still? </em>It is more than seven years since&#x2014;"<br><br>"Yes, more than seven years," he interrupted. "Don't cry, Trixie! I assure you I don't grieve any longer, or even think of Clarissa, except now and then, when something occurs which perhaps brings her to my memory. But I have never fallen in love again. Not with any of the delightful girls you have been so obliging as to cast in my way! I believe I could never feel for another what I once felt for Clarissa, so it seems to me that to be making a bid for the sort of girl you would wish me to marry would be a shabby thing to do. I have a fortune large enough to make me an eligible suitor, and I daresay the Stockwells would give their consent, were I to offer for Miss Alice&#x2014;"<br><br>"Indeed they would! And Alice is disposed to have a <em>tendre </em>for you, which you must have perceived. So, why&#x2014;?"<br><br>"Well, for that very reason, perhaps. Such a beautiful and spirited girl is worthy of so much more than I could give her. Lady Hester, on the other hand&#x2014;" He broke off, the ready laughter springing to his eyes. "What a wretch you are, Trix! You are forcing me to say such things as must make me sound like the veriest coxcomb!"<br><br>"What you mean," said Beatrix ruthlessly, "is that Lady Hester is too insipid to like anyone!"<br><br>"I don't mean anything of the sort. She is shy, but I don't think her insipid. Indeed, I have sometimes suspected that if she were not for ever being snubbed by her father, and her quite odious sisters, she would show that she has a lively sense of the ridiculous. Let us say, merely, that she has not a romantic disposition! And as I must surely be considered to be beyond the age of romance, I believe that with mutual liking to help us we may be tolerably comfortable together. Her situation now is unhappy, which encourages me to hope that she may look favourably upon my proposal."<br><br>Mrs. Wetherby uttered a scornful exclamation, and even her stolid spouse blinked. That he rated his very obvious attractions low was one of the things one liked in Gary, but this was coming it a trifle too strong. "No doubt of that," Warren said dryly. "May as well wish you happy at once, Gary&#x2014;which I'm sure I hope you will be. Not but what&#x2014; However, it is no business of mine! You know best what will suit you."<br><br>It was not to be expected that Mrs. Wetherby could bring herself to agree with this pronouncement; but she appeared to realize the futility of further argument, and beyond prophesying disaster she said no more until she was alone with her husband. She had then a great deal to say, which he bore with great patience, entering no caveat until she said bitterly: "How any man who had been betrothed to Clarissa Lincombe could offer for Hester Theale is something I shall never understand&#x2014;nor anyone else, I daresay!"<br><br>At this point, Warren's brow wrinkled, and he said in a dubious tone: "Well, I don't know."<br><br></p><h2>Brava, Strega Nona!: A Heartwarming Pop-Up Book</h2><p>Tomie dePaola&#x2019;s Strega Nona has been loved by generations of children&#x2019;s book readers, but they&#x2019;ve never seen her like this!<p> In six spreads of pop-up magnificence, paper engineered by the renowned #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling team of Sabuda and Reinhart, Strega Nona shares her words of wisdom for leading a magical life, all rendered in Tomie dePaola&#x2019;s classic style.</p><p> With doors to open, tabs to pull, and a host of other interactive features, readers will be drawn into Strega Nona&#x2019;s world in a way they&#x2019;ve never been before. <i>Brava, Strega Nona!</i> is a glorious celebration of important values that will introduce a whole new generation of readers to this lovable character.<br><br></p><p></p></p><p><strong>Eric Carle and Tomie dePaola: Author One-on-One</strong> <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle</strong> is the creator, author, and illustrator of <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> and many other children&#x2019;s books. <strong>Tomie dePaola</strong> is the author and illustrator of <i>Strega Nona: Her Story</i> and countless other books. They recently had a conversation about their careers as picture book authors. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> When I was only four years old, I announced to my family in particular and to the world in general that I was going to become an artist, and write stories and draw pictures for books. I never swayed from that early declaration. I&#x2019;ve always been curious to know, what inspired you to become a creator and illustrator of picture books? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> My career began as a graphic designer and for a number of years I worked as an art director for an advertising agency in New York. In the mid 1960's Bill Martin, Jr. saw an ad of a red lobster that I had designed and asked me to illustrate his <i>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</i> Well, I was set on fire! I was so inspired by this book, and the opportunity to illustrate it changed my life. After that, I started to create my own books, both words and pictures, and really it was then that I had found my true course in life. <br> <br> Now, I have a question for you, Tomie. How would you describe your artistic style, and has it changed over time? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> My illustration style is heavily influenced by folk art--strong simple shapes, bold lines, color, color, color and a deceptive simplicity. My style began to develop early in art school, and through the years, it hasn&#x2019;t changed very much, but it has refined itself. How would you describe yours? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> My aim with my work is to simplify and refine, be logical and harmonious. I like to use simple shapes, bright colors and a lot of white space. I write for the child inside of me. That is always where I begin. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> I do, as well. The only audience I keep in mind is that four-year-old in me. People sometimes ask me what advice I would give to young artists. I always think of the wonderful advice I received from my twin cousins when they were in art school in the late '30s. They told me, &#x201c;Practice, practice, practice and don&#x2019;t copy.&#x201d; <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> I often tell people about the four magic letters: DO IT. I want to be encouraging but I can only offer the example of my own experience, which is just one approach. There are many wonderful artists to learn about, which is important. But you must use your own imagination. You have to just do it. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> How do you feel knowing that a copy of <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> is sold every 30 seconds, somewhere in the world? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> It is hard for me, maybe for others too, to grasp this concept. But I am truly honored that my story is enjoyed by so many and that it is now being shared by a generation of parents who grew up with my book. How about your <i>Strega Nona</i>. She is one of your most popular characters. Can you share how she came to be? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> In the &#x2018;70s when I was teaching at a college, we were required to attend faculty meetings. I always sat in the back with a yellow legal pad. Everyone thought I was taking notes. At one meeting a doodle appeared of a little lady with a big nose and a big chin. I named her Strega Nona, and the rest is history. Speaking of history, how will you be celebrating the third annual <i>Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> Day this year? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> On <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> Day, March 20th, I will probably be at home with my wife, Bobbie (I am a bit of a hermit, actually). But I will be saying a little toast to the caterpillar for whom I have a special place in my heart. And speaking of holidays, isn&#x2019;t your favorite holiday Christmas. Do you have a special Christmas memory? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> Christmas is my favorite holiday. My favorite Christmas was the one when I received tons and tons of art supplies: everything from an easel to paints, pads and pads of paper, and &#x201c;how to draw&#x201d; books. <br>Tomie dePaola was born in Meriden, Connecticut, in 1934 to a family of Irish and Italian background.

Eicher aspires to become the standard reference in its field, and it very nearly succeeds. It is strictly a military history of the Civil War, which means it eschews all the political and social context setting that takes up so much space in James M. McPherson's heralded <i>Battle Cry of Freedom</i> (still the best single volume on the war) and focuses almost exclusively on the actual campaigns and combat. Eicher challenges a line of historians that includes Bruce Catton and Shelby Foote, whose own books on the war are classics. He is not quite as good a writer as either of these two, but he does bring something to the subject that Catton and Foote do not: An entire generation's worth of new scholarship. As Eicher himself points out, a big chunk of his sources only became available in the 1990s. This is not to suggest that he offers a dramatic reinterpretation. On certain fundamental topics he has familiar opinions: "I am convinced that the Confederate States of America could not have emerged victorious in the Civil War." Eicher can write with occasional verve, too. Of an obscure operation in New Mexico, he deadpans, "Though [Major General Harry Hopkins] Sibley's strategic goals were fuzzy, his military successes on the surface seemed pleasing, particularly to a commander who experienced much of his campaign under the influence of liquor." <p> Yet the real strength of <i>The Longest Night</i> is its intricate detail. Although few readers probably want to know how many different types of bronze smoothbore mortars were used in battle (11, according to Eicher), other facts and figures are fresh and fascinating: "Of the 246,712 wounded treated in Federal hospitals during the war, 922 causes were reported as traceable to wounds from edged weapons of any kind [i.e., swords, knives, and bayonets]. Most of those resulted from personal arguments or use by camp guards rather than by fighting on the field." The bulk of the book is chronological retelling of the war, starting with Fort Sumter and ending with the death of President Lincoln and the various Confederate surrenders. It is a strong entry on a subject that continues to fascinate readers everywhere. <i>--John Miller</i></p><b>James M.

Although Ernest and Julio remain the most familiar Gallos, they have a younger brother, Joseph, Jr., who has no stake in the family firm. When the two elders, who built the immensely profitable E &amp; J Gallo Winery, sued Joseph during the mid-1980's to prevent him from putting his own name on the cheese he made for sale, they opened a Pandora's box. Drawing on the vast troves of documentary material released by the protracted litigation, and on his access to many Gallo principals, relatives, and ex-employees, Hawkes (Feminism on Trial, 1986) offers a revelatory, generation- spanning chronicle. In addition to piercing the corporate veil, the author discloses that Joseph, Sr., an Italian immigrant who became a successful grape grower in northern California, murdered his wife and then killed himself in 1933. His estate gave Ernest and Julio the means to get into the wine business in a big way--with an unacknowledged assist from a bootlegging uncle. Hawkes leaves little doubt that the ruthlessly autocratic Ernest euchred a trusting Joseph, Jr., out of a potentially sizable legacy. Moreover, she points out, for all its oenological pretensions, Gallo's most profitable products are so-called street wines (Thunderbird, Night Train Express, Gypsy Rose). Covered as well are: the strong-arm tactics used to gain distribution for Gallo wares; frequent run-ins with federal authorities; the peace of mind attained by Joseph, Jr., despite primal betrayals; and a host of familial fancies long accepted as facts. While Hawkes gives Joseph, Jr., the benefit of almost every doubt, she provides a slick reckoning on the Gallos, a would-be dynasty that, by her account, may be nearing the end of the line. (Eight pages of b&amp;w photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Re-arguing a trademark infringement case already settled by the courts, Hawkes ( Feminism on Trial ) presents so much immaterial evidence that the book becomes tedious. At issue: the legality of California rancher Joseph Gallo to label his consumer cheese product with his full name, as he does on his bulk shipments. Filing their successful injunction suit in 1988 were his brothers, E. and J. Gallo Winery owners Ernest (b. 1909) and Julio (b. 1910). In a defeated counterclaim, the then 70-year-old Joseph sued for a third share of the wine company as inheritance from their parents' estate. Yet the youngest son, who had been raised by his brothers after their father murdered their mother and then committed suicide when Joseph was 13, had never been a partner in the firm and had left his brothers' employ in 1967. To show Ernest as an aggressive, sleazy commander-in-chief and Julio as biddable, Hawkes dredges up corporate history (inadvertently the most interesting aspect of the book) and family relationships (only Joseph is depicted as likable) through three generations. The case, which severed the elderly siblings' friendship, is poignant, but Hawkes's blatant advocacy journalism leaves the reader curious to hear the other side's story. Photos.

I&#x2019;ve not read a novel wherein medicine, the practice of it, is made as germane to the storytelling process, to the overall narrative, as the author manages to make it happen here. The medical detail is stunning, but it never overwhelms the humane and narrative aspects of this moving and ambitious novel. This is a first-person narration where the first-person voice appears to disappear, but never entirely; only in the beginning are we aware that the voice addressing us is speaking from the womb! And what terrific characters--even the most minor players are given a full history. There is also a sense of great foreboding; by the midpoint of the story, one dreads what will further befall these characters. The foreshadowing is present in the chapter titles, too--&#x2018;The School of Suffering&#x2019; not least among them! <em>Cutting for Stone</em> is a remarkable achievement.<em>--John Irving</em></p> <p>(Photo � Maki Galimberti)</p><b>Abraham Verghese </b>is also the author of <b>The Tennis Partner</b>, a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book, and <b>My Own Country</b>, a National Book Critics Circle finalist.

The UConn Lady Huskies trailing Tennessee by one, 65&#x2013;64... ten seconds... nine. The fans are on their feet.... Coach Geno Auriemma has the ball in the hands of UConn&#x2019;s best clutch scorer since Diana Taurasi. And with the national championship on the line in... seven seconds, there&#x2019;s no one he trusts more than the southpaw from Dorset with the droopy socks.... Five seconds... This is it, folks. Geno&#x2019;s Huskies against Pat Summitt&#x2019;s Lady Vols for all of the marbles.... Three... Procter&#x2019;s at the top of the key.

UConn wins! UConn wins! Her teammates are mobbing Molly! She disappears under the pile of blue and white Husky jerseys. Oh, my, this has to be the most exciting game I have ever... <p></p></i>Molly Procter, age nine and three quarters, faked left, dribbled right, and heaved the ball to the portable basketball hoop in the drive-way, tongue stuck out of the side of her mouth. Nothing but net. She pumped her fist in the air as Jen Beckwith pulled into the driveway in her red Saab convertible. It was Jen&#x2019;s driveway. Jen&#x2019;s hoop. Jen lived in the little cottage right across Sour Cherry Lane from Molly&#x2019;s and was starting point guard on the Dorset High Fighting Pilgrims. Really nice and not at all stuck up even though she was a star athlete, straight A student, gorgeous, and her grandmother was the richest woman in town. Jen and her mom weren&#x2019;t rich themselves. Jen&#x2019;s dad died a few years back, and her mom had to work day and night at a chiropractor&#x2019;s office. Jen was working full-time herself that summer at the bakery in The Works. Just home from work now in her bright green employee&#x2019;s T-shirt. <p></p>"Okay, squirt, show me what you&#x2019;ve got." Jen positioned herself to defend Molly one-on-one. <p></p>Molly ran a hand through her head of unruly gold ringlets. She was a gangly, frecklefaced girl with a rabbity pink nose. Her wire-rimmed glasses were slightly bent out of shape. Her T-shirt and gym shorts hung loose on her frame. Baggy white socks drooped down to her scuffed sneakers. "You&#x2019;re on. Prepare to be dazzled." She gave Jen her awesome head fake, then dribbled right and&#x2014; <p></p>Jen promptly slapped the ball away. "You still telegraph when you&#x2019;re going to the hoop." <p></p>"Do not." <p></p>"Do too. You stick your tongue out." <p></p>"So did Michael Jordon." <p></p>"Guess what? You&#x2019;re not M. J." <p></p>"Duh, I know. I&#x2019;m M. <i>P</i>." <p></p>"Tell me, M. <i>P</i>., when was the last time you tried combing that hair? And what is <i>up</i> with those dorky socks?" <p></p>"They&#x2019;re my trademark. When I turn pro, Nike is going to pay me a fortune for them." <p></p>"I see...." <p></p>"That&#x2019;s what <i>you</i> need. A trademark." <p></p>"So that&#x2019;s my problem," Jen sighed, turning gloomy on her. <p></p>"Hey, are you okay?" <p></p>Jen mustered a faint smile. "Sure, you bet." <p></p>"Just because I don&#x2019;t have breasts doesn&#x2019;t mean I can&#x2019;t keep secrets, you know." <p></p>"I know." <p></p>"Is this about that party you threw when your mom was gone?" <p></p>"Work on your head fake, squirt," Jen growled. "And dinner&#x2019;s in about an hour if you want some." Then she headed for the house and went inside. <p></p>Molly had been spending more and more of her time over at Jen&#x2019;s ever since her own mom had taken up with Clay. Molly had zero interest in letting Clay be her new dad. She already had a dad. Besides, she&#x2019;d hated Clay ever since that first morning three weeks back when he came slouching out of her mom&#x2019;s bedroom with no shirt on and his jeans slung low; a wiry, rough-looking stranger with a lit cigarette between his lips. Molly was sitting at the kitchen table, tapping away on her mom&#x2019;s computer. <p></p>Clay popped open a can of beer first thing and drank deeply from it, watching her. The very first words he said to her were, "Don&#x2019;t you have somewhere else to be?" <p></p>Molly said, "I live here." <p></p>And he said, "Well, so do I from now on. And I don&#x2019;t like lippy little girls." <p></p>"I&#x2019;m <i>not</i> a little girl." <p></p>Then Clay ordered her to stay out of the root cellar underneath the kitchen from now on. "You&#x2019;re never to go down there, understand? There are snakes down there." <p></p>"I&#x2019;m not afraid of snakes," she snorted. "And <i>you</i> can&#x2019;t tell me what to do." <p></p>"Girl, don&#x2019;t ever talk back to me again," Clay shot back, smacking her in the ear with his open hand so hard that it rang for a whole day. <p></p>And so she had stayed away from the root cellar. <p></p>Molly used to have a happy life. Her mom was beautiful and talented and sweet. Author of a really cool series of kids&#x2019; books about a Kerry blue terrier named Molly (in honor of guess who) that solved mysteries on a farm. All of the characters in her books were animals. The farm was based on Aunt Meggie&#x2019;s place up in Blue Hill, Maine, where they usually spent every August. Molly&#x2019;s dad was a historian at Wesleyan and just a really wise person. He knew the Latin words for things, and loved to work with his hands. He&#x2019;d made their kitchen table himself out of oak. He&#x2019;d put in French doors to brighten up the kitchen and built a raised teak deck outside it where they could eat supper at another table he&#x2019;d built. Molly helped him do everything. She was his Designated Measurer. Always, no matter how busy he was, her dad made time for her. Taught her how to use her mom&#x2019;s computer when she was really little so she could communicate with him by e-mail when he was at the university. <p></p>But Molly&#x2019;s parents weren&#x2019;t the same people anymore. Her mom wasn&#x2019;t lively and bright-eyed, wasn&#x2019;t <i>there</i>. In her place there was a glassy-eyed stranger who scarcely seemed to notice that Molly was even alive. She&#x2019;d stopped writing&#x2014;Clay even dismantled her computer and stashed it in a closet. She didn&#x2019;t go out to the grocery store or anywhere else. Some days, she never came out of her room. Just stayed in there with Clay. Or with Hector, the Mexican man who worked for Clay. Once, she was in there with both men at the same time and Molly could hear her moaning real loud. After that, Molly took to sleeping in the tree house that she and her dad had made together in the old sugar maple. She had a sleeping bag up there and a flashlight so she could read. She was plenty comfy unless it rained. Then she&#x2019;d tap on Jen&#x2019;s window and Jen would let her sleep with her. <p></p>Molly wanted her dad to come home. She wasn&#x2019;t sure why he&#x2019;d left, except that her mom had made him. He&#x2019;d told Molly he&#x2019;d be staying with a friend for a few days. But a few days turned into a few weeks. And then her mom started going out to the Indian casinos after dinner and stumbling home late, drunk, and sometimes not alone. Clay was the third man she&#x2019;d brought home, and the first who&#x2019;d stayed. Molly sure wished her dad would kick him out and everything would be like it used to be. <p></p>But it wasn&#x2019;t. <p></p>Now that school was out for summer she either worked on her game in Jen&#x2019;s driveway or headed out to her own job on Big Sister Island, which was close to Sour Cherry. The footpath through the woods at the end of the lane led right into the Peck&#x2019;s Point Nature Preserve. The wooden causeway out to the island was just across a meadow from there. Molly&#x2019;s friend Mitch used to live on Big Sister until he went away. Mitch watched movies for a living and had the hugest collection of DVDs Molly had ever seen. He was real cool about loaning them to her. Real cool period, even though he was a Knicks fan and everyone knew the Knicks sucked and the Celtics ruled. Molly missed him a lot. Although the old lady who&#x2019;d moved into his house, Bella, was okay. Bella rescued stray kitties&#x2014;eighteen of them at last count. She kept them in Mitch&#x2019;s barn while she tried to find homes for them. She paid Molly five dollars a day to feed them and clean up after them. Some of the kitties liked to be petted. Others, the feral ones, would hiss at Molly and try to rake her. <p></p>Big Sister was where Molly took her dad the night he did try to come home. It had been a total disaster. Clay went chest-to-chest with him out in the driveway. Told him he didn&#x2019;t live there anymore, then proceeded to beat the snot out of him. Molly watched it all in horror from her tree house. Clay flailing away at him with his fists, kicking him in the ribs after he was down. By the time Molly had scrambled down and screamed at Clay to stop, her dad was lying on the ground in a bloody, sobbing heap. Clay told Molly if he ever saw her dad anywhere near the house again he&#x2019;d "cut" him. <p></p>Molly had taken her dad by the hand and led him through the woods out to the island. He didn&#x2019;t respond when Molly talked to him. Just kept sobbing. He needed her to take care of him and so she had. There was an ancient, tattered sofa out in the barn. She got him settled on it, found a few tarps to cover him with, and told him he&#x2019;d be safe there. In the morning, she cleaned his face and gave him some food from Bella&#x2019;s refrigerator after Bella left to run errands. Bella had no idea Molly&#x2019;s dad was out there. Mustn&#x2019;t know. She might not like the idea. <p></p>Every morning at dawn, Molly would sneak out there and hide her dad somewhere on the island for the day. In the boat house. Or a nice sheltered area of beach, where he&#x2019;d nibble at what ever food Molly had pilfered from Bella. He was incredibly sad. Cried a lot. Hardly ever spoke. <p></p>The only words he ever said to her were: "They won&#x2019;t let me back in." <p></p>"I know, Daddy. Are you okay?" <p></p>"They won&#x2019;t let me back in." <p></p>Evenings, Molly would tuck him back in the barn for the night. She didn&#x2019;t know how else to help him. She loved her dad. She wanted to be a good daughter. <p></p>On her way home through the woods one night, Molly stumbled upon a man who was crouched there in the darkness with a pair of binoculars. <p></p>"Hey, quit that!" she protested when he shined a flashlight in her eyes. <p></p>He immediately shushed her. <p></p>So she whispered, "What are you doing here, mister?" <p></p>"I&#x2019;m a biologist with the D.E.P. We&#x2019;re trying to track down a fisher that&#x2019;s been spotted in these woods." <p></p>"What&#x2019;s a fisher?" <p></p>"It&#x2019;s a carnivorous predator. Sort of like a bobcat. Lets out a god-awful shriek. Eats small dogs, cats..." <p></p>"Next you&#x2019;re going to tell me it eats little girls," Molly scoffed. <p></p>"I&#x2019;m perfectly serious. They wander down from Canada. Speaking of which, where did <i>you</i> wander from?" <p></p>"Prunus Cerebus." <p></p>"Prunus Cerebus? Which planet is that?" <p></p>"It&#x2019;s not a planet, you dope. That&#x2019;s Latin for Sour Cherry." <p></p>"Oh, I get it. You live on Sour Cherry Lane. What&#x2019;s your name?" She told him. <p></p>"What are you doing out here this time of night, Molly?" <p></p>"Exploring." <p></p>"Well, you&#x2019;d better get on home." <p></p>Which she had, though she thought he was full of it. There were no fishers in the woods anywhere near Dorset. If there were, her dad would have told her. Besides, if that man really were a biologist with the Department of Environmental Protection he&#x2019;d know that Prunus Cerebus wasn&#x2019;t a planet. <p></p>No question about it, Molly&#x2019;s life was turning strange. <p></p>And then it went from strange to just totally sucky. <p></p>Somehow, Bella got wind that Molly&#x2019;s dad was staying out there. She called in that mean trooper lady, who sent him away to the hospital. Then the trooper lady tracked Molly down when Molly was trying to shoot hoops over at Jen&#x2019;s. He was going to be okay, she promised Molly before she started asking her a whole bunch of questions about Clay and her mom. Acting like she wanted to be Molly&#x2019;s friend. <p></p>Her dad really did start to feel better. He even found a place to stay that was right nearby. His first night back, as Molly lay there in her tree house reading a library book by flashlight, she allowed herself to hope that maybe everything would be okay again. Clay and Hector would go away soon. Her dad would move back in and her mom would smile and be herself again. Everyone would be happy. <p></p>It was a warm night. Somewhere down below her a skunk was marking its turf, the stink wafting its way up to Molly&#x2019;s nostrils. Scarcely a breeze stirred the leaves around her. All was quiet. <p></p>Until she heard rapid footsteps somewhere down the lane. And a fierce struggle of some kind. Someone groaning. Then a horrifying shriek that pierced the still of the night. It was a sound unlike anything Molly Procter had ever heard before. And it was not any fisher. Molly knew exactly what it was. <p></p>It was a man dying. <p></p>Excerpted from The Sour Cherry Surprise by David Handler <p></p>Copyright � 2008 by David Handler <p></p>Published in 2008 by Thomas Dunne Books, St. Martin&#x2019;s Minotaur <p></p>All rights reserved.

His fiction has received Newbery, Carnegie, Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, and Will Eisner Awards. His novel American Gods is being made into a TV miniseries to air in 2017. Originally from England, he now lives in the United States.Next to the title character, the most popular cast member of the acclaimed Sandman comic book series is Sandman's sister, Death--no hooded grim reaper, but a perky, black-clad Goth chick. In retelling the series' "Season of Mists" story line, writer-artist Thompson depicts Death in manga (mainstream Japanese comics) style, as a button-cute punkette. Similarly, her godlike siblings are given huge eyes and exaggerated expressions, and whole compositions take on the cartoony, freewheeling look of <i>shoujo</i>, the manga aimed at girls. Lucifer has abandoned Hell, tossed out the inhabitants, and given Sandman the key. While the Lord of Dreams (Sandman) deals with his newly acquired real estate, Hell's evictees crash at Death's place, where her sisters, Despair and Delerium, throw them a party. Thompson is one of few American artists to successfully mimic manga, and she imparts a lighthearted tone to an originally somber tale. Her approach will probably attract American manga fans, who don't much follow American comics, and Sandman fans, who will devour any stories featuring its characters, regardless of style. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

To usher in the new millennium, THE BEST AMERICAN SHORT STORIES 2000 brims with a rich variety of lyrical and wise stories about our country&#x2019;s past, present, and future. This year&#x2019;s editor, the best-selling author E. L. Doctorow, has chosen new works by Raymond Carver, Amy Bloom, Ha Jin, Walter Mosley, and Jhumpa Lahiri, among others.<br> The most popular compendium of its kind, THE BEST AMERICAN SHORT STORIES is the only volume that offers the finest short fiction each year, chosen by a distinguished author.</p><p>When a great annual collection comes out, it's hard to know the reason why. Was there a bumper crop of high-quality stories, or was this year's guest editor especially gifted at winnowing out the good ones? Either way, the 2000 edition of <i>The Best American Short Stories</i> is a standout in a series that can be uneven. Its editor, E.L. Doctorow, seems to have a fondness for the "what if?" story, the kind of tale that posits an imagination-prodding question and then attempts to answer it. Nathan Englander's "The Gilgul of Park Avenue" asks: What if a WASPy financial analyst, riding in a cab one day, discovers to his surprise that he is irrevocably Jewish? In "The Ordinary Son," Ron Carlson asks: What if you are the only average person in a family of certifiable geniuses? And Allan Gurganus's "He's at the Office" asks: What if the quintessential postwar American working man were forced to retire? This last story is narrated by the man's grown son, who at the story's opening takes his dad for a walk. Though it's the present day, the father is still dressed in his full 1950s businessman regalia, including camel-hair overcoat and felt hat. The two walk by a teenager. "The boy smiled. 'Way bad look on you, guy.'" <blockquote>My father, seeking interpretation, stared at me. I simply shook my head no. I could not explain Dad to himself in terms of tidal fashion trends. All I said was "I think he likes you." </blockquote> The exchange typifies the writing showcased in this anthology: in these stories, again and again, we find a breakdown of human communication that is sprightly, humorous, and devastatingly complete. A few more of the terrific stories featured herein: Amy Bloom's "The Story," a goofy metafiction about a villainous divorcee; Geoffrey Becker's "Black Elvis," which tells of, well, a black Elvis; and Jhumpa Lahiri's "The Third and Final Continent," a story of an Indian man who moves to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Like the collection itself, Lahiri's story amasses a lovely, funny mood as it goes along. <i>--Claire Dederer</i>E.L.

It is also one of the best introductions to Deleuze's thought, establishing many of his central philosophical positions. <br><br>In <i>Nietzsche and Philosophy</i>, Deleuze identifies and explores three crucial concepts in Nietzschean thought-multiplicity, becoming, and affirmation-and clarifies Nietzsche's views regarding the will to power, eternal return, nihilism, and difference. For Deleuze, Nietzsche challenged conventional philosophical ideas and provided a means of escape from Hegel's dialectical thinking, which had come to dominate French philosophy. He also offered a path toward a politics of difference. In this new edition, Michael Hardt's foreword examines the profound influence of Deleuze's provocative interpretations on the study of Nietzsche, which opened a whole new avenue in postwar thought.</p><p>Demonstrates how Nietzsche initiated a new mode of philosophical thinking. First published in 1962, this landmark book is one of the first to dispute the deep-seated assumption that dialectics provides the only possible basis for radical thought.Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995) was professor of philosophy at the University of Paris, Vincennes-St. Denis. He wrote several seminal philosophical works, including <i>Difference and Repetition</i>, and, with F�lix Guattari, <i>Anti-Oedipus</i>, <i>A Thousand Plateaus</i>, and <i>What Is Philosophy?</i>Michael Hardt is professor of literature and romance studies at Duke University. He is the author of <i>Gilles Deleuze: An Apprenticeship in Philosophy</i> and the coauthor (with Antonio Negri) of <i>Empire</i> and <i>Multitude</i>.Hugh Tomlinson is also the translator of other works by Deleuze, including <i>Bergonism</i> and <i>Cinema 2: The Time Image</i>.</p><h2>The Island of Heavenly Daze (Heavenly Daze Series #1)</h2><p><p>To a casual visitor, the island of Heavenly Daze is just like a dozen others off the coast of Maine.

However, the story of&nbsp;&nbsp;the women who followed Jesus goes almost unnoticed&nbsp;&nbsp;in the gospels. <i>The Magdalene&nbsp;&nbsp;Gospel</i> shatters the centuries of silence imposed on&nbsp;&nbsp;these women. Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus, and others devoted their lives to Jesus; they&nbsp;&nbsp;gave up everything for him, because he had given&nbsp;&nbsp;them everything. As Jesus gave his life for them,&nbsp;&nbsp;these women shared his pain at the foot of the&nbsp;&nbsp;cross, and risked their lives by caring for his&nbsp;&nbsp;crucified body. In the dark nights and gloomy days&nbsp;&nbsp;between Jesus' death and his resurrection, Mary&nbsp;&nbsp;Magdalene and the other women tried to make sense of&nbsp;&nbsp;their Lord's tragic end. This is their story.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Magdalene Gospel</i> tells the very&nbsp;&nbsp;personal, moving stories of how Jesus changed people's&nbsp;&nbsp;lives. Stricken with the unspeakable pain of&nbsp;&nbsp;losing Jesus, Mary Magdalene and her friends grieve,&nbsp;&nbsp;cry, and care for one another. They emerge from this&nbsp;&nbsp;dark hour by caring for others, as Jesus had cared&nbsp;&nbsp;for them. Weakly, but then with increasing&nbsp;&nbsp;strength, they give voice to the depth of their love of&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus and their reasons for following him. In&nbsp;&nbsp;sharing their stories, Mary Magdalene and her sister&nbsp;&nbsp;mourners begin to shed the burden of grief. No other&nbsp;&nbsp;book allows women disciples to tell their own&nbsp;&nbsp;stories. This fresh perspective, presented in a&nbsp;&nbsp;captivatingly personal, yet very accessible style,&nbsp;&nbsp;enlivens the well-known story of Jesus. <i>The&nbsp;&nbsp;Magdalene Gospel</i> is good news for&nbsp;&nbsp;everyone.</p><p>Mary Ellen Ashcroft is college chaplain and professor of English at Kalamazoo Christian College (Michigan). She has previously taught at Bethel College in St. Paul, Minnesota.From the Preface--- "The Magdalene Gospel" and "Spirited Women" (together or separately) invite women to find their place in that first, inner circle of those who followed Christ. These books have given me the joy of seeing and hearing from women who have felt brought into that circle for the first time. <p>When a book is first published, the author often feels as if she&#x2019;s given birth: one phase is over and a new one begins in which the author&#x2019;s main task is partly feeding and guiding, but mainly watching. Since The Magdalene Gospel&#x2019;s first appearance in 1995, it has gained a wonderful life of its own, and I&#x2019;ve enjoyed hearing from believers and skeptics who&#x2019;ve been touched, provoked, and intrigued by its message. From its first publicist, who said to me, &#x201c;Mary Ellen, I don&#x2019;t call myself a religious person at all, but the other night at a party I heard myself saying, &#x2018;You know, you&#x2019;re wrong about Jesus&#x2014;let me tell you about how he treated women...&#x2019;&#x201d; to many other women who realized that they could find themselves as followers of Christ. </p><p>I&#x2019;ve especially loved the many creative responses to The Magdalene Gospel (and now to Spirited Women). Parts of The Magdalene Gospel have been produced in dramatic form in places in the United States, Canada, and England. The productions have been as diverse as a student group in Ohio using parts of the book on stage to an ecumenical version done at a number of churches in Texas to a costumed version, interspersed with original music performed by students and choir at Clare College in Cambridge, England. In the few productions I&#x2019;ve been privileged to see live or on video, different characters are used and different themes of the book emphasized. Some are set within the time of Christ and some in a much more contemporary setting; some feature a large cast, some one woman. Several have included original musical compositions sung by an individual or a choir. </p><p>One of the most creative responses to The Magdalene Gospel comes out of Berkeley, California, where a program called The Magdalene Journey began with a group of women who wanted to read the stories aloud and bring them to life for a larger congregation during Holy Week. They found, as I have when working with groups of women, that inevitably their own stories of healing and encounters with Christ became a part of the first women&#x2019;s stories; in the end their production included both. After the first performance, a number of women asked to be involved, and so the original group formed new groups to move through The Magdalene Journey, which is now in its fifth year. </p><p>I have used parts of The Magdalene Gospel as the basis for retreats and conferences. Often I use a theme arising from one of the women&#x2019;s stories followed by a dramatic reading of the story, and then questions for participants to take into times of silence and then perhaps into group discussion. I have also used parts for sermons and interspersed readings with a performance of Mozart&#x2019;s Requiem. I have used some stories as guided meditations in hospital visiting. </p><p>The Magdalene Gospel has also been used for study and book groups. One Graduate Christian Fellowship staff person told me she&#x2019;d tried to get a women&#x2019;s graduate student Bible study going and found no takers; she started a study using The Magdalene Gospel and found a whole group who read, discussed, and responded to the gospel. </p><p>The notes are important to this book because many readers will want to read it with a Bible in hand. I have also included in this new edition questions for individual and group study. These questions may also be adapted for use at conferences and retreats. </p><p>In Spirited Women, I have continued with my stories about women in the very early church, following some of the women in The Magdalene Gospel and including other stories such as that of the Samaritan woman. It is my conviction that women have felt as if they were on the outside of the story of Jesus and the early church for too long; my hope and prayer is that these books will help women claim their place as followers of Jesus.</p></p><h2>Forget the Vet: Homeopathic Remedies for Cats &amp; Dogs</h2><p><b>'Forget the Vet&#x2019; focuses on the many health benefits of practicing natural remedies. Cooking easy homemade holistic recipes, and treating your pet to a homeopathic agenda, may prevent many trips to your vet&#x2019;s office.

Currently at the pinnacle of his remarkable career, Mark has created a new American School of Violin Playing that promises to quickly take its place among the great works of violin pedagogy. While utilizing classic methods of violin technique and theory, the Mark O&#39;Connor Violin Method boldly adds uniquely American elements such as jazz, Latin, rock, folk, ragtime and improvisation. This eventual 10-book series for teachers and students assures success by taking an orderly and gradual approach using appealing and memorable tunes. Each volume seeks to instill a deep appreciation of America&#39;s musical history with background stories of all those that contributed to this rich heritage: Immigrants, African-American slaves, soldiers all contributed mightily to what has become the new American Classical Music. But simply creating fine players is not the goal of this method. Like any great movement, the Mark O&#39;Connor Violin Method seeks a loftier goal: That young people everywhere will fall in love with playing music.Currently, the Mark O&#39;Connor Violin Method includes Volumes 1 and 2, including CDs with Mark playing all tunes. The CDs also contain piano accompaniment tracks. Piano accompaniment books for Volumes 1 and 2 also available now. Volumes 3-10 are in the works, as are volumes for viola, cello, double bass and string orchestra.The O&#39;Connor Violin Method employs classic violin technique and theory to teach students to become skilled violinists. But more than that, the O&#39;Connor Violin Method uses familiar traditional American music to engage and motivate the young student. The lavishly illustrated books focus on well known traditional American tunes such as Oh! Susanna, Amazing Grace, Appalachia Waltz and Soldier&#39;s Joy.

The war department wanted 3,000 volunteers, and it didn't care who they were; they would be expendable, with an expected casualty rate of 85 percent. The men who took up the challenge were, in the words of one, "bums and cast-offs" with rap sheets and reputations for trouble. One war reporter described them as "Dead End Kids," but by the end of their five-month mission, those that remained had become the legendary "Merrill's Marauders." From award-winning historian <b>Gavin Mortimer</b>, <i>Merrill's Marauders</i> is the story of the American World War II special forces unit originally codenamed "Galahad," which, in 1944, fought its way through 700 miles of snake-infested Burmese jungle--what Winston Churchill described as "the most forbidding fighting country imaginable." Though their mission to disrupt Japanese supply lines and communications was ultimately successful, paving the way for the Allied conquest of Burma, the Marauders paid a terrible price for their victory. By the time they captured the crucial airfield of Myitkyina in May 1944, only 200 of the original 3,000 men remained; the rest were dead, wounded, or riddled with disease. This is the definitive nonfiction narrative of arguably the most extraordinary, but also unsung, American special forces unit in World War II.</p></p><p>From late 1941 through 1942, Japan overran much of the Pacific, including Burma. In March 1943, British Gen. Orde Wingate and his famed long-range penetration unit, the &#x201c;Chindits,&#x201d; cut through the Burmese jungle, skirmishing with Japanese troops, destroying bridges, and cutting rail lines. Their advance and success shocked the Japanese, who had been conquering East Asia at an unstoppable pace. The Chindits&#x2019; success, however, came at a price: they lost one-third of their three thousand men during the two-month-long mission. But though the Chindits were ultimately pushed back to India, their mission set the foundation for long-range penetration troops into Japanese-controlled territory.&nbsp;Months later, in August 1943, a call went out for three thousand American troops to volunteer for a hazardous secret mission in the Burmese jungle. Casualties were expected to be 85 percent.&nbsp;Despite these unfavorable odds, the required number of troops was raised, comprising men with varied military and personal backgrounds, such as Sioux and Japanese-Americans who later formed the core of the unit&#x2019;s elite intelligence and reconnaissance platoons. Code-named &#x201c;Unit Galahad&#x201d; but lacking an official designation, they were christened the &#x201c;Dead End Kids&#x201d; by an embedded newspaper correspondent. After Col. Charles Hunter, the unit&#x2019;s commander during training, was reassigned to second-in-command and replaced by Brig. Gen. Frank Merrill, other members of the press coined the more popular nickname for the unit that eventually stuck: Merrill&#x2019;s Marauders.&nbsp;After training for months in India, the Marauders made their way into Burma in February 1944 and cut their way over mountain passes and through thick jungle growth, fighting off malaria and dysentery. The Marauders continued their trek through the Burmese jungle and engaged in several skirmishes with Japanese troops on their way to their ultimate goal: capturing the vital Japanese-controlled airstrip at Myitkyina, which linked northern Burma to the rest of the country.&nbsp;Once the airfield was captured through a series of brilliant outflanking movements assisted by Chinese units and Kachin hill tribes, the Marauders dug in to defend it until troops from the First Chinese Army arrived. Only two hundred of the original three thousand Marauders remained in fighting condition when the support came. General Joseph Stilwell reorganized the group with reinforcements and then focused on taking the town of Myitkyina, which the Allies finally wrestled from the Japanese in August 1943.&nbsp;For their bravery in the harshest fighting conditions, the group received a Presidential Unit Citation, six Distinguished Service Crosses, four Legions of Merit, and forty-four Silver Stars. <i>Merrill&#x2019;s Marauders</i> is the story of this highly decorated unit, one of the toughest special forces units of World War II.<br>Author bio:Award-winning historian Gavin Mortimer is one of the world&#x2019;s foremost experts on World War II special forces. His history of the wartime Special Air Service was praised by the BBC as &#x201c;a&nbsp;highly authoritative but also absorbing account,&#x201d; and it is currently under option from GK-TV in Hollywood.

The mission: advance into enemy-held territory in Burma to disrupt Japanese supply lines and ultimately recapture an important Allied airstrip at Myitkyina.&nbsp;The men of the 5307th Compositional Unit (Provisional), eventually nicknamed &#x201c;Merrill&#x2019;s Marauders&#x201d; after their commander, Brig. Gen. Frank Merrill, trained in India for months before crossing into enemy territory in February 1944. After traveling some seven hundred miles through grueling jungle conditions and encountering Japanese troops every step of the way, the Marauders, ravaged by disease and malnutrition, arrived at the Myitkyina airstrip in May 1944. There, they bravely held their position until reinforcements arrived, even as their numbers were whittled down to only two hundred able-bodied troops from the original three thousand.&nbsp;Written by award-winning historian Gavin Mortimer, <i>Merrill&#x2019;s Marauders</i> profiles one of the most important and toughest special operations forces of World War II through new archival research and personal interviews with the surviving members of the Marauders.</p><h2>Love&#39;s Redeeming Work: The Anglican Quest for Holiness</h2><p><em>Love's Redeeming Work</em> is a major anthology of Anglican writings, with 250+ entries that span from the sixteenth through the twentieth centuries.

That was the only sound now, lamplight momentarily gilding an imprudent lens.</p><p>That stroke of the bell called for meditation.</p><p>Next would come a statement from the head of house&#x2014;Tabini, in this case. Bren had read the program somewhat before he entered a shadow too deep for humans to read.</p><p>And whatever the aiji had to say, the gathered lords would parse it for every detail. It was important&#x2014;an address that could, if it went wrong, break the union of lords apart. It always could. Any chance word, gone amiss, could break the Association at any time&#x2014;and in this context, bets were doubled. Tabini had made deals with human authorities, sent atevi to work on the space station, admitting a flood of new technologies. He&#x2019;d had to, for a whole host of economic and practical reasons that sliced right across the ordinary order of politics, throwing conservatives into alliance with the most liberal of western powers.</p><p>He&#x2019;d had to reach across traditional lines, across ethnical lines&#x2014;across associational lines.</p><p>And so the agreement with humans widened, policy deliberately blind to the causes of the last world war, dancing across the shards of old resentments, skipping over divides of opinion that had once swum with blood.</p><p>Most of all, the crisis in the heavens and the need to secure a voice in that resolution had shoved the whole economy into a hellishly scary rush, a fever pitch run that no one at first had thought would last more than a month.</p><p>No longer than three years.</p><p>Then no longer than six.</p><p>As yet there was no slowdown, no cooldown, no pause for breath&#x2014;and no meeting of the associated lords&#x2014;until this.</p><p>The silence after that bell was so absolute that breathing itself seemed a disturbance...and in that silence, of all things, someone dropped a program, a crack of parchment on stone that set a twitch&#x2014;if not a killing reflex&#x2014;into every hair-triggered, Guild-trained nerve in the chamber.</p><p>Every Guild member had to skip a heartbeat. Every lord present had to make a conscious decision not to dive below the benches.</p><p>But it was only the next aiji, <b>their</b> someday ruler, diving almost to the edge of the flower-decked sarcophagus to rescue that wayward, unseemly folio.</p><p>In his haste it escaped his fingers on his retreat. Twice.</p><p>Bren winced.</p><p><b>Three times</b><i>.</i></p><p>The boy had it. Scrambled back to his place in the standing line.</p><p>Cajeiri, Tabini&#x2019;s and Damiri&#x2019;s son, the hope of the Association, Tatiseigi&#x2019;s grand-nephew&#x2014;was the height and weight of the average human teenager&#x2014;but not, by any means, average, human, or teenaged. Cajeiri tried&#x2014;God knew he tried, but somehow his feet found obstacles, his hands lost their grip on perfectly ordinary objects, and when Cajeiri would swear to all gods most fortunate that he was standing still, everyone else called it fidgeting.</p><p>Now of all times...in front of the whole assembled Association, the lords of the <b>aishidi&#x2019;tat</b><i>,</i> this was <b>no</b> time for boys to be boys, or for a child to be&#x2014;whatever he might be.</p><p>Cajeiri was invisible in the first row again. Silence hung all about him. The dignity of the highest houses settled on his young shoulders. Tabini, Tatiseigi&#x2014;now Ilisidi, in whose care the young unfortunate attended the ceremony&#x2014;were all in question in that behavior. Fosterage was the rule of the great houses, once a child of rank left the cradle. Tatiseigi, the maternal uncle, had had a go at applying courtly polish, in the rural, rigid politics of the Atageini stronghold in the central west. Now Ilisidi had him: in her district,<br><b>modernist</b> meant someone who installed a flush toilet in a thousand-year-old stronghold.</p><p>God help the boy.</p><p>A second bell. Solemnity recovered. This was the second point, fragile second, unfortunate second: atevi lived by numbers, died by the numbers. <b>Two</b> of anything presumed there would be a third. There <b>must</b> be a third. The very note, echoing in the stone recesses of the place, on this occasion, gathered up the tension in the air and prepared to braid it into a cord...if the third bell, please God, would only ring without unfortunate omen.</p><p>Cajeiri held himself absolutely still. <b>Two</b> would ring ominously even in an atevi six-year-old&#x2019;s brain. <b>Two</b> always meant <b>pay attention: another will follow</b><i>.</i></p><p>Bren had been to Malguri himself. In a way, he wished he could go back there, have another try of his own at a life a human wasn&#x2019;t regularly admitted even to see. In a certain measure he so envied the boy that chance.</p><p>Ilisidi had her hands full. He did know that. The boy, thus far, with the best intentions, had destroyed two historic porcelains, set off a major security alarm, and ridden a startled mecheita across newly-poured cement in Tatiseigi&#x2019;s formal garden.</p><p>Finally, unbearably, with the least shifting of bodies in anticipation, Tabini, head of house, foremost of the Ragi atevi, aiji of the whole <b>aishidi&#x2019;tat</b><i>,</i> moved out of the row to the single lighted lamp that sat before the sarcophagus.</p><p>Tabini, tall shadow, took a slender straw, took light from one lamp and lit one of two others.</p><p>Two lamps lit.</p><p>Jago, armed and informed, nudged Bren&#x2019;s hand with the back of hers. <b>Pay attention. Be on your guard</b><i>.</i></p><p>Banichi, on his other side, didn&#x2019;t move.</p><p>Every bodyguard in the whole chamber must be thinking the same, prepared for anything. It was in all the machimi, the history-plays: in the feudal age, in Malguri&#x2019;s age, the time of bright banners and heraldry, assemblies thus invited had been murdered wholesale, slaughtered by hidden archers. Whole tables of diners had fallen ill at once. Ladies had perished in poisoned baths&#x2014;name the death: someone had delivered it.</p><p>Hearts beat, atevi, and in one case, human, with utter trepidation.</p><p>Tabini, damn him, knew it. The third bell had not yet rung. And Tabini turned, in that terrible, unprecedented interval.</p><p><i>&#x201c;</i><b>I speak</b><i>,&#x201d;</i> Tabini declared, in that resonant, still-young voice, &#x201c;between the second and the third bell. <b>We live</b>...between the second and the third bell of our associated lives. <b>We live</b>...on the edge of decision and chance. <i>We</i> <b>live</b>...between expectation and fulfillment. Between the second and the third bell of our collective existence, I am Valasi&#x2019;s son, I am Valasi&#x2019;s heir...I <b>am</b> Valasi&#x2019;s successor.&#x201d;</p><p>After the hasdrawad and the tashrid, the bicameral legislature, had determined for the second time that Ilisidi would <b>not</b> be aiji, they had appointed Tabini to head the <b>aishidi&#x2019;tat</b><i>.</i></p><p>And the whole assembly, caught between the bells and the lights, heard felicitous, redeeming <b>threes</b><i>.</i> Every atevi nerve rang as a human could only intellectually comprehend&#x2014;not feel, gut-deep: felicitous <b>one</b><i>,</i> then the two strokes of <b>we live</b><i>.</i> Then <b>I speak</b><i>,</i> disastrous two&#x2014;felicitous <b>three</b> of <b>we live</b><i>.</i> And now no resolution of the first <b>cahi</b><i>,</i> the first proposal, at all, but the infelicitous <b>two</b> of <b>I am</b><i>.</i> A human brain could short-circuit keeping up with the bracketing structures, but Bren swore he felt it in his own nerves: and he <b>felt</b> his knees go weak when Tabini gave the assembly that third, redemptive <b>I am</b><i>.</i> The whole audience held its breath, angry as they must be at this tactic. <b>That</b><i>,</i> in this audience, didn&#x2019;t matter. They were caught up, snared, and couldn&#x2019;t move. <b>Daren&#x2019;t</b> move. <b>Felt</b> the <b>aishidi&#x2019;tat</b> threatened&#x2014;and were drawn, unwillingly, to hope that it, and their lives, continued.</p><p>&#x201c;<b>I speak</b> as your appointed guide into time to come,&#x201d; Tabini said. And delivered the <b>next</b> third stroke, that painfully wound-up, merciful third: &#x201c;<b>I speak</b> for the unity of the assembly of us all.</p><p>&#x201c;We do not forget,&#x201d; Tabini continued, as nerve and flesh all but liquified in relief and bodyguards stood down from red alert. Tabini swept on, in possession of all attention. Thank <b>God</b> no program dropped. Breathing itself was at a minimum. Tabini&#x2019;s oratory was all fortunate threes now, rapid, hammering into nerves still resounding to two strokes of the bell, still waiting for the resolution of their universe. &#x201c;We do not break our strong connections with all that Valasi-aiji built. We do not abrogate our traditions. The more knowledge we acquire, the more we rationally comprehend the universe, the more we control our own destiny&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Sensitive spot: the number-counters who so powerfully ruled the traditional world had long discounted the numbers of the heavens, meaning they had deliberately, scornfully dismissed the work of astronomers, who had failed to foresee the Landing.</p><p>But the modern-day Astronomer Emeritus, a genius of his age, brandished numbers that confounded the number-counters&#x2014;those mathematicians who claimed to guide the less talented to understand the balance of the universe. The newly respectable Astronomer Emeritus was Tabini&#x2019;s. And with Tabini&#x2019;s blessing, the Astronomer Emeritus worked to understand the stars and make reliable paths through the heavens. The numbers flowing down from the heavens now ran a starship and promised to connect atevi to a rational universe that also accounted for humans&#x2014;</p><p>To a universe, what was more, that brought them a <i>second</i> foreign species. That this new species happened to be hostile&#x2014;well, well, but the soaring optimism of good numbers insisted the difficulties could be overcome, irresistibly so.</p><p>Atevi relied on a rational universe.</p><p>Humans on the island enclave of Mospheira had faith in miracles.</p><p>Humans on the starship over their heads had more faith in a second armed starship and a planetful of allies, in a universe otherwise sparse with life.</p><p>But atevi being an independent lot, fiercely so, and hating worse than poison to be handed a fait accompli involving someone else&#x2019;s numbers, had politely declined to make too strong a point that a human species that had misplaced its own home planet was not infallible. In the main atevi were impressed by what they saw going on in the heavens&#x2014;what, at least, the dedicated and the suspicious alike, armed with binoculars, could make out as going on in the heavens. It was at least a personal enough contact with the presence up there to make it a national obsession, and binoculars and telescopes enjoyed a vogue at garden parties and secret meetings.</p><p>The latter&#x2014;since a last die-hard cadre of the traditionalists wanted their world back the way Tabini had inherited it, <b>sans</b> telescopes, <b>sans</b> autographed roof tiles&#x2014;<b>sans</b> the frantic push of atevi interests skyward. But the majority even of the conservatives had dropped the traditionalist fight over the very concept of Air Traffic Control: they&#x2019;d lost that argument, long since, and scrambled to get aerospace industry in their own districts.</p><p>Yet did the builders of such facilities properly consider the numbers? They derived them from new-fangled <b>computers</b><i>,</i> to the contempt of the die-hard traditionalists and the dedicated &#x2019;counters. Dared one trust them?</p><p>&#x201c;The more numbers we gain,&#x201d; Tabini was saying to the assembled lords, &#x201c;the more I myself appreciate Valasi&#x2019;s work. <b>Not</b><i>,</i>&#x201d; Tabini added, before certain die-hard conservatives burst a blood vessel, &#x201c;that I would argue less with my father, but certainly that I would listen more. <b>His</b> time was too soon to know everything: but in his wisdom he laid a foundation for the <b>aishidi&#x2019;tat</b> that would assure a strong leadership...and now I know that he saw change coming. Now I know that he prepared for it. Now I know that my father was a wise man.&#x201d;</p><p>Oh, <b>that</b> was clever: generational authority was a tenet of the conservatives...while the aiji&#x2019;s increasing power over their lives as a central authority was a continual sore point. Now Tabini equated one with the other, wound the cord of their own argument around a strong young fist, and yanked.</p><p>Count your fingers when dealing with Tabini. His enemies and his allies both said that.</p><p>&#x201c;My father warned me,&#x201d; Tabini said. &#x201c;He saw us growing reliant on advances that we would never have the chance to make for ourselves. But <b>because</b> these inventions, like all real things, come of true numbers, he saw that they use the natural universe, he saw that they were good, he saw that if we did invent them they would be much the same. He had, however, every intent of shaping what came to us into <b>our own design</b><i>,</i> he had every intent of maintaining sovereignty&#x2014;&#x201d; Another sore point. &#x201c;<b>And because it follows from every previous invention</b>&#x2014;<b>he clearly had every intent of going into space</b><i>.</i>&#x201d; The cadence dragged them right into it...and marched on, leaving the fiercest opponents to mull over a very strong point: if not that aim, what aim? &#x201c;In the new numbers, our economy runs white-hot. We <b>have</b> no hunger, we <b>have</b> no feuds, we <b>have</b> no want of employment for the clans. We mine, we build, we distribute, and we have no scarcity anywhere. Thanks to our vantage from orbit we rescue a forest from blight. We warn a village on the coast to put up the storm shutters. We cure diseases we once thought hopeless. In the new numbers we send and speak and travel from one end to the other of every association, without wires or roads that blight the world. In the new numbers, we draw power from the sun&#x2019;s free light without smoke to obscure the sky.</p><p>&#x201c;Never let us forget what is <b>kabiu</b><i>,</i> or break the rhythm of the seasons, or of the wild things, or of our own bodies. Let us never forget how to build a fire, light a candle, or use our hands to spin thread. Let no single village forget how to weave cloth, shape a pot, or hunt its own food. If a machine made a pot, it serves for a while. But if hands made it, it is <b>kabiu</b><i>,</i> and fit to pass to our children. This was the true understanding I learned from Valasi. This is what I now give to my son. This is what he will in his day give to his son. This observance of true value is what keeps <b>kabiu</b><i>.</i> This is the source of things unseen. This quality, this <b>fitness</b> remains so long as we have the keen sense of what is real. And in a hundred thousand pots, one is <b>kabiu</b><i>.</i></p><p>&#x201c;We <b>can</b> heal the sick, warn against weather, and supply common pots to every village in the world. But let us teach our children to make what is <b>kabiu</b><i>,</i> and to recognize what is <b>kabiu</b><i>,</i> and to value what is <b>kabiu</b><i>.</i></p><p>&#x201c;This is the unity of one. This is the <b>aishidi&#x2019;tat</b><i>.</i> This is our heritage.&#x201d;</p><p>A bell rang. Tabini lit the third lamp in utter stillness.</p><p>The whole universe seemed to start again.

But there is new territory to cover with old friendslike the AM radioand new: a ceiling fan, an electric blanket and a microwave among them, as well as a hearing aid handmade by Albert Einstein. They all head to Mars after learning that there resides a force of warring appliances with plans to invade Earth. The toaster simply and persuasively speaks of peace to the planet's inhabitants and is elected president (a reign which lasts only until he returns to Earth). What is Disch talking about? Perhaps it doesn't matter, for while he seems to be amusing himself, much of what he writes will entertain readers, too. The epic elements will more than appease those awaiting this sequel, but the most exuberantly funny scenes are those in which the appliances while away the time with their distinctive brand of gossip. Ages 10-up. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Grade 5 Up Like The Brave Little Toaster (Doubleday, 1986), this satiric sequel in which the toaster and his appliance friends journey to Mars to save the world will have more adult than child appeal. Rogue appliances on Mars are planning to invade the earth, destroy mankind, and end the horrors of planned obsolescence. Through heroic efforts and the electoral process, the rogue appliances are convinced to explore space instead. While children could easily read the brief adventure story, few will understand or appreciate Disch's parody of science fiction formulae and his manipulation of Einstein's theories.

Chen has been creating beautiful, entertaining, and deeply moving picture books over the past twelve years. To depict the old culture of ancient China, he has relied upon myth and legend in many of his books.<i>Starred Review.</i> Grade 1-5&#x2013;This elegant picture book recounts a legend involving the painter Han Gan, who lived in China 1200 years ago. Though he came from a poor family, his talent was recognized early and he won acceptance to the academy for official painters. The young man loved to draw horses, and he always drew them tethered, as he warned, my horses are so alive they might leap right off the paper. One night, a great warrior visited him and asked him to bring to life a valiant steed. The artist was frustrated with his attempt, but as he tried to destroy the painting in the fire, the horse came to life and rode away with the warrior on its back. The great horse did not need to eat, drink, or sleep, and was invincible in battle, until it took pity on its vanquished foes. The steed threw off its rider and returned to be part of a painting on the wall of Han Gan's home. The tale is crisply and concisely told. The double-page illustrations are dominated by strong browns, blacks, and reds, and are painted directly on silk in the style of Han Gan. The oversize art underscores the tale's drama and epic scale with plenty of period detail, balanced with large open areas. Altogether, this is a masterfully told picture book, and one whose timeless message will resonate with many readers.<i>&#x2013;Marilyn Taniguchi, Beverly Hills Public Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Through Biddy's journal, readers are introduced not only to the last great year of the Negro Leagues, but also to the institutional racism and blatant bigotry that existed in mid-20th-century America. The teen documents the action of the games, records the jokes and discussions that take place on the long bus rides to distant ball parks, complains about his younger sister, and writes about his hopes and desires for the future. A sometimes right fielder, he realizes that he will never be a great player and turns his dreams to attending college and becoming a journalist or sports writer. Intertwined with detailed descriptions of hits, runs, wins, and losses, Biddy describes his anger at not being served at a five-and-dime lunch counter and his yearning to stand up for his rights. Myers refers to actual players of the time: everyone talks about Jackie Robinson and Satchel Paige; Willie Mays is a member of the Birmingham Black Barons; and Biddy meets Hank Aaron, who plays for the Indiana Clowns. A final section includes a fictional epilogue, a historical note, black-and-white photos, and information about the author. Direct readers who want more information to Patricia McKissack's Black Diamond: The Story of the Negro Baseball League (Scholastic, 1994).-Shawn Brommer, South Central Library System, Madison, WI</p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>Gr. 5-7. In this fictional journal, part of the My Name Is America series, 17-year-old Biddy Owens tells of his year as "equipment manager, scorekeeper, errand boy, and sometimes right fielder" for the Birmingham Black Barons. The year is 1948, the last year of the Negro Leagues, and the book offers not just one boy's experiences and growth but also an appreciation of the trials and triumphs of black ballplayers, particularly in the South. Biddy's episodic story takes readers from his home, where economic troubles strain relations, to the road, where a remark like "We don't serve no nigras here" is commonplace to the ballparks of America, in which the playing field is generally level (if a little rocky). The book has two other notable aspects. First, the writing is infused with a love of baseball that is never sappy. And second, this novel clearly portrays the ongoing racial prejudice of the era without making that the focus of the story. A very readable addition to the series. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

An introduction to each city or town (together with descriptions of its neighborhoods and museum houses) explains how the area developed and how its architectural styles document its past.<br>There are 701 illustrations--historic and current--to instruct and entice house-lovers. The 173 maps show the location of every neighborhood and every museum house included--and point the way to the most interesting districts. <br>The book's introduction provides a chronological over-view of the entire West--with illustrations and maps that show the region's principal styles of pre-1940 domestic architecture. The appendix points out the geographic and design factors that have contributed to the overall character of various western neighborhoods.<br>Like the McAlesters' A Field Guide to American Houses, this new book is a labor of love and a work of immense knowledge that will stand as a classic in its field: an invaluable book for people fascinated with houses, for architectural buffs, and for actual--and armchair--travelers in the American West</p><p>Virginia McAlester is a graduate of Harvard-Radcliffe College and attended Harvard Graduate School of Design.

Sketched here in fine strokes are 172 historic neighborhoods and 200 museum homes in 110 cities, covering 17 Western states from the Dakotas to Texas to the Pacific. As with other McAlester titles, there's a lot here for the price: historic, cultural, and architectural details; essays on Western settlement patterns, surveying, and neighborhood planning; and 300 illustrations and 175 maps. State-by-state treatment varies greatly, however; California claims a third of the book, while Idaho, Nevada, the Dakotas, and Utah receive a scant 20 pages or fewer.

Composed in an exquisite style, Hebrews urged new Christians to hold fast to their new faith lest they lose their opportunity to witness the long-awaited fulfillment of God's covenant with Israel.<br><br>The sage and persuasive Christian writer draws analogies between the heroes and drama of Jewish sacred Scriptures and first-century Christian experience.

They constitute a rich source of philosophical and spiritual wisdom with answers that often bypass conundrums or controversies which have limited debate for many centuries.

He is the author of <em>The War Lovers</em>. <strong>Sebastian Junger</strong> is an internationally acclaimed author and a contributing editor to <i>Vanity Fair</i>, and has been awarded a National Magazine Award and an SAIS Novartis Prize for journalism. He is the author of <em>War</em>. Read on to see Sebastian Junger and Evan Thomas talk about their books.<br> <br> <p></p> <p><b>Evan Thomas</b>: War really is hell in your book. And yet it seems to captivate some of the men who fight it. Why?</p> <p><b>Sebastian Junger</b>: War is hell, as the saying goes--but it isn't only that. It's a lot of other things, too--most of them delivered in forms that are way more pure and intense than what is available back home. The undeniable hellishness of war forces men to bond in ways that aren't necessary--or even possible-- in civilian society. The closest thing to it might be the parent-child bond, but that is not reciprocal. Children are generally not prepared to die for their parents, whereas the men in a platoon of combat infantry for the most part are prepared to do that for each other. For a lot of men, the security of being enclosed by a group like that apparently outweighs the terrors of being in combat. During World War II, wounded soldiers kept going AWOL from the rear-base hospitals in order to rejoin their units on the front line. Clearly, for those men, rejoining their comrades was more important than the risk of death.</p> <p>I'm curious about the reactions of foot soldiers in previous wars--the Civil War, the Spanish-American War. Are there letters from soldiers describing their anguish at being separated from their comrades? Or is this a modern phenomenon? </p> <p><b>Thomas</b>: In the Spanish-American War, Teddy Roosevelt made a cult out of his band of brothers, the Rough Riders, with the twist that he was bringing together gentlemen and cowboys to be true Americans. It was a romantic ideal but largely realized in the short (several week) war they fought--two battles, about a 15 percent casualty rate. The anguish you speak of was felt by the Rough Riders who were left behind--there was no room on the transports for roughly a third of Roosevelt's troopers, and they had to stay behind in Florida. Roosevelt wrote of them weeping over being separated from their comrades and missing out on the fight.</p> <p>Roosevelt's war lust was sated by the Spanish-American War--for a time. He was not a notably bellicose president ("Talk softly but carry a big stick"). But when World War I came, he was almost pathologically driven to get back into the fight. He badgered President Wilson to let him raise a division. (Wilson, not wanting to create a martyr, said no.) Do you think the brotherhood of combat is in some ways addictive? What is it like for the soldiers and marines coming home?</p> <p><b>Junger</b>: It's amazing to see these same themes played out war after war. Politicians seize war for themselves, in some ways, and the public certainly holds them accountable for it--but the men who actually do the fighting are extraordinarily conflicted about it all. Only one man in the platoon I was with chose to leave the army after the deployment--Brendan O'Byrne, a main character in my book and now someone I consider a good friend. A few weeks ago we were hanging out with a family I know, and the talk turned to how rough the fighting was in Afghanistan. The mother, a woman in her thirties, asked Brendan if there was anything he missed about the experience. Brendan looked at her and said, without any irony, "Yes, almost all of it." I think what Brendan meant was that he missed an existence where every detail mattered--whether you tied your shoelaces, whether you cleaned your rifle--and you never had to question the allegiance of your friends. As Brendan said at another point, "There are guys in the platoon who straight-up hate each other-- but they'd all die for each other." Once they've been exposed to that, it's very hard for these guys to go back to a seemingly meaningless and ill-defined civilian life.</p> <p> What happened to the men after they returned from their adventures with Roosevelt? Where did their lives lead them?</p> <p><b>Thomas</b>: The Rough Riders seem to have had endless reunions--but nothing like the PTSD so widely reported today. But perhaps that was because they were only fighting for about a month--a "splendid little war," as diplomat John Hay called it, apparently without irony. In <i>The War Lovers</i>, I was looking at another kind of camaraderie--the bond of men who want to get the country into war, who think that war will somehow restore the nation to spiritual greatness. Roosevelt and his best friend, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, believed that America at the end of the 19th century had become "overcivilized"--that young men were turning soft and needed to somehow stir "the wolf rising in the heart," as Roosevelt put it. "All the great races have been fighting races," he said. It is significant that Roosevelt and Lodge, who pushed America to go to war with Spain in 1898, had written about war a great deal but never seen it. President William McKinley resisted; he had, as he noted, seen "the dead piled up at Antietam" in the Civil War. But the hawks in America were able to roll the doves, not for the last time.</p> <p>Before <i>The War Lovers</i> I wrote <i>Sea of Thunder</i>, a book about the last naval battle of World War II, Leyte Gulf. I interviewed a number of survivors from the USS Johnston, a destroyer sunk in the battle after an unbelievably brave fight against superior forces. About 220 men went in the water but only about half of them were rescued. Because of a series of mistakes by the navy, they were left in the water for two and half days. The sharks came on the first night. For a long time, the survivors did not talk much about it. But then, after Tom Brokaw wrote <i>The Greatest Generation</i>, they began having reunions and speaking--almost compulsively--bout their experiences. The recollections are often harrowing. Yet even years later, when the veterans compiled their recollections in a book of about eighty oral histories, the veterans did not speak of their own fear, with only one exception, as I recall. Somehow acknowledging fear remained a taboo.</p> <p></p> <p>In <i>War</i> you write about fear in clinical and fascinating ways. Did you have a hard time getting men to talk about fear? </p> <p><b>Junger</b>: Getting the men to talk about fear was very hard because, well, I think they were afraid of it. Their biggest worry seemed to be failing the other men of the platoon in some way, and whenever someone got killed, a common reaction was to search their own actions for blame. They didn't want to believe that a good man could get killed for no reason; someone had to be at fault. During combat, their personal fear effectively got subsumed by the greater anxiety that they would fail to do their job and someone else would get killed. The shame of that would last a lifetime, and they would literally do suicidal things to help platoon mates who were in danger. The classic story of a man throwing himself on a hand grenade--certain death, but an action that will almost certainly save everyone else--is neither a Hollywood clich� nor something that only happened in wars gone by. It is something that happens with regularity, and I don't think it can be explained by "army training" or any kind of suicidal impulse. I think that kind of courage goes to the heart of what it means to be human and to affiliate with others in a kind of transcendent way. Of course, once you have experienced a bond like that, everything else looks pathetic and uninteresting. That may be one reason combat vets have such a hard time returning to society..</p> <p>My guess is that the survivors of the USS Johnston were more traumatized by the deaths of their comrades than the prospect of their own death. Did any of them speak to that? What were their nightmares about? Has anyone studied the effect of that trauma on their lives--divorce rate, suicide rate, that kind of thing?</p> <p><b>Thomas</b>: They certainly described the deaths of their colleagues--who went mad from drinking seawater, or were killed by sharks, or died from untreated wounds or exposure (the seawater was about 86 degrees at night, cold if you spent all night immersed in it). Some just swam away and drowned. In one or two cases, men begged to be put out of their misery and were. There were complicated emotions over the deaths. There wasn't enough room on the rafts for all the men, so when one died, it made room for another. I am sure there was terrible guilt, but I didn't get into it with the survivors I interviewed. I don't think they were studied as a cohort. I think they were expected to go on with their lives, and I think by and large they did.</p> <p>Nations are changed by war--but somehow, only for a time. We have a way of forgetting the horrors of war, in the need young men (and old men who missed war) have to some experience the greatest challenge to their manhood. This was true in the period I wrote about in <i>The War Lovers</i>, more than three decades after the Civil War: men like Roosevelt and Lodge wanted to somehow experience the glories of war, and not think too hard about the way wars often turn out in unexpected ways. I know in Cuba, where I visited to research <i>The War Lovers</i>, the Cubans don't think of the Americans as their liberators from Spanish rule, but rather as foreign invaders. That's unfair, and in many ways just plain wrong, but not so hard to understand if you put yourself in the shoes of a country occupied by a foreign army. Some things never change.</p> <br><br>Evan Thomas has been the Assistant Managing Editor of <i>Newsweek</i> since 1991.

He was reputed to be capable of bilocation: the ability to be in two places at one time. His charisms were numerous and sensational, and quickly made Padre Pio the subject of world-wide interest. Yet in spite of these spectacular abilities, the most remarkable of his miracles must have occurred in the confessional... Hundreds and thousands of pilgrims awaited their turn at the confessional of Padre Pio. In many instances, it wasn&#39;t uncommon for these people to wait for as long as fifteen and twenty days to have their confessions heard. Was it because he had a special grace which enabled him to penetrate consciences and stimulate his penitents to rise up and live in God&#39;s grace and love? Whatever the reason, he took sinners to his bosom and showed God&#39;s love and tender compassion. His entire priestly life was dedicated to the task of winning souls for God.</p><p></p><h2>Ball Four</h2><p>When Ball Four was first published in 1970, it ignited a firestorm of controversy that raged far beyond the boundaries of baseball. From players and team executives to journalists and broadcasters, everyone had a mostly negative opinion about Jim Bouton's nearly 500- page expose. The former Yankee pitching star was labeled a Judas, a Benedict Arnold and a social leper. Then Commissioner Bowie Kuhn attempted to force Bouton to sign a statement that the stories he told weren't true. The San Diego Padres burned a copy of Ball Four in protest of its release. However, the majority of the fans who bought tickets to watch their diamond heroes loved Ball Four. Even the people who didn't ordinarily follow baseball devoured the hilariously funny and revealing book. In fact, during its 30-year life, Ball Four has sold more than five million copies worldwide. For the millennium edition of this historic book, Bouton has written a highly entertaining epilogue, reflecting upon his life at the age of 60, the traumatic death of his daughter, and the heart-warming invitation from the Yankees to play in his first Old-Timers' Day game since his exile from the club. Says the author about his ground-breaking book, "By establishing new boundaries, Ball Four changed sports reporting at least to the extent that, after the book, it was no longer possible to sell the milk and cookies image again ... besides, you can get sick on milk and cookies".<p>Ball Four is a high-and-inside fastball which will forever be a journalistic classic.</p></p><p>As a player, former hurler Jim Bouton did nothing half-way; he threw so hard he'd lose his cap on almost every pitch. In the early '70s, he tossed off one of the funniest, most revealing, insider's takes on baseball life in <i>Ball Four,</i> his diary of the season he tried to pitch his way back from oblivion on the strength of a knuckler. The real curve, though, is Bouton's honesty. He carves humans out of heroes, and shines a light into the game's corners. A quarter century later, Bouton's unique baseball voice can still bring the heat.For the new edition of this historic book, Jim Bouton has written a highly entertaining epilogue, reflecting upon his life at the age of 60, the traumatic death of his daughter, and the heartwarming invitation from the Yankees to play in his first Old-Timers&#x2019; Day game since his exile from the club.

For Pierce's lover Rose Ryder, another path unfolds: she&#x2019;s drawn into a cult that promises to exorcise her demons. It is the dark of the year, between Halloween and the winter solstice, and the gateway is open between the worlds of the living and the dead. A great cycle of time is ending, and Pierce and Rosie, Samantha and Rose Ryder must take sides in an age-old war that is approaching the final battle...Or is it? D�monomania is a journey into the very mystery of existence: what is, what went before, and what could break through at any moment in our lives.</p><p>John Crowley's powerfully mysterious <i>D�monomania</i> adds flesh to the world he imagined in <i>�gypt</i> and <i>Love and Sleep</i>. In this book, as in all his books, Crowley transports faithful readers to a place where time, place, and meaning come unstuck. It is in some ways the story of the end of the world as it might be, or might have been, a novel of history, eschatology, and faith with unforgettable characters and hauntingly lovely sentences. If the world's end is neither bang nor whimper but "like the shivers that pass over a horse's skin," how is it perceived by the people living through it?<p> Historian Pierce Moffett finds his key to understanding in New York state's Faraway Hills, as do his lover, Rose Ryder, and single mom Rosie Rasmussen, whose daughter seems to suffer from d�monomania--spiritual possession by Renaissance magician John Dee. Each character must pick a careful path between the colliding juggernauts of past and present, magic and mundane. The wind of apocalypse is blowing:</p><p> </p><blockquote>"Scary wind.... What if it's the one?" she said.<p> "What one?" he said.... He in fact knew what one, for it was from him that she had heard mythologies of wind, how it bloweth where it listeth, one part of Nature not under God's thumb and therefore perhaps at the disposal of our Enemy; she had heard his stories about changer winds, how one had once blown away the Spanish Armada and thus saved England from Catholic conquest, a famous wind which if you went to look for it in the records of the time wasn't there. </p></blockquote> In typical Crowley style, magic is seamlessly woven into the narrative. Pierce is writing the story of the end of the world while it happens, Rose joins a cult that promises salvation, and Rosie inherits a spooky legacy that might hold the secret to saving her daughter. All are involved in deep exchanges of power, and all must yield to what Crowley calls the "queasy pressure of Fate."<p> Crowley describes <i>D�monomania</i> best when he writes about Pierce's book: "The book... was about magic, secret histories, and the End of the World, an event that Pierce would suggest was under way undetectably even as he wrote, as the reader read." This is a complex, disturbing, and beautiful book, one that will bear rereading. Crowley's writing is gorgeous in places, frustrating in others, but always irresistible. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>For the past two decades, John Crowley has created some of the most beautiful and evocative fiction written anywhere.

The lives of Renaissance wizard John Dee and rogue philosopher Giordano Bruno, who was burned at the stake, haunt the present: their stories, true and false, are being reenacted in the peaceful Faraway Hills and may hold the key to the future. <br><br>It is the dark of the year, between Halloween and the winter solstice, and the gateway is open between the worlds of the living and the dead. Pierce and Rosie, Samantha and Rose Ryder, and their enemies and allies -- who have powers hidden until now--must take sides in an age-old war that is approaching the final battle. <br><br>Or is it? In a John Crowley novel, nothing is as it seems. Crowley draws us into a cosmic tug-of-war between familiarity and strangeness, couples us with characters much like ourselves, and then works his own potent magic on the proceedings. <b>Daemonomania</b> is a journey into the very mystery of existence: what is, what went before, and what could break through at any moment in our lives.</p><h2>Dangerous Girls</h2><p><b>Paradise quickly gets gruesome in this thrilling page-turner with a plot that&#x2019;s ripped from the headlines and a twist that defies the imagination.</b><br><br>It&#x2019;s Spring Break of senior year.

Shots!&#x201d;<br> <br>We yell it together, slamming our hands on the sticky wooden table. The dreadlocked waiter pours a row of something lurid, neon blue. It&#x2019;s our first night on the island, and the music is almost too loud for me to think&#x2014;some European dance-pop thing that shakes the crowded beach club, making the glasses quiver and the blood vibrate in my chest.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aruba, bitches!&#x201d; Elise raises her shot in a toast, lights splintering off the glass, golden in her hair.<br> <br>&#x201c;Spring break!&#x201d; The group whoops, and then I&#x2019;m gulping down the drink, shuddering at the sickly bittersweet taste and the familiar burn that snakes down my throat. Melanie screws her face up, gagging; Max and AK pump the air and howl, but Elise is already reaching for another, plain tequila this time, with a side of salt and lime.<br> <br>&#x201c;Easy, girl,&#x201d; Tate says, and laughs to Elise, one arm slung around my shoulder.<br> <br>She ignores him, turning to me with a wicked smile. &#x201c;Bottoms up, babe.&#x201d; Elise grins, but instead of shaking the salt out on her hand, she sprinkles it on my neck, leaning in to lick up along my collarbone before downing the shot.<br> <br>I shiver at the touch and playfully shove her away. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re drunk.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And you need to loosen up!&#x201d; Elise shimmies, blond hair flying out around her bare shoulders. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re on vacation. Time to party!&#x201d;<br> <br>She grabs Mel and Chelsea and heads for the dance floor, her hips already moving to the thunder of bass. They dance and whirl, swallowed up into the tight press of sweaty bodies.<br> <br>I search for the rest of our group. Chelsea&#x2019;s twin brother, Max, is already off bro-ing it up with AK by the bar, trying their luck with a pair of Swedish-looking blondes. Max&#x2019;s fair hair and AK&#x2019;s black curls are bent close, to hear the girls or check out their cleavage, I don&#x2019;t even have to guess. Lamar sprawls on the other side of the booth, the lights hitting blue and deep indigo against his black skin. He peels the label from his beer bottle as Chelsea, who left the dance floor, tries to tempt him out. She grinds above him like a lap dancer, laughing, until he finally catches her around the waist and follows her into the dark, one hand draped possessively across her shoulder.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m left alone in the corner with Tate. I slide closer, kissing him until I feel the tension in his shoulders. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d; He shakes it off. &#x201c;I guess I&#x2019;m still stressed from finals. Everyone said Yale would get back to me before&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They will,&#x201d; I tell him firmly. His blond hair is mussed, so I reach up to push it out of his eyes. I let my hand stay there, resting against his cheek. &#x201c;They have to take you.&#x201d; I grin, teasing, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the chosen one. I mean, if you don&#x2019;t get in, what hope is there for the rest of us? I&#x2019;ll be sweeping floors at community college.&#x201d; I laugh, but Tate still looks distracted. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be fine,&#x201d; I reassure him again. &#x201c;And even if it&#x2019;s not, there&#x2019;s nothing you can do now. You might as well have fun.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tate exhales, finally smiling. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; He leans to drop a kiss on my forehead. &#x201c;I guess I just need to de-stress.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Lucky for you, we&#x2019;re in the right place for that.&#x201d; I lace my fingers in his. &#x201c;A whole week, no parents, no rules&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; I reach up to kiss him, and this time, there&#x2019;s no tension, just a familiar low heat building, and Tate&#x2019;s hands sliding along the edge of my shirt&#x2014;<br> <br>Arms suddenly encircle me from behind, dragging me away. Elise. She squeezes tighter, kissing my cheek.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you sitting around for?&#x201d; She yanks me to my feet. &#x201c;Come! Dance!&#x201d; Elise grabs Tate with her other hand; we exchange a look as she drags us deeper into the crowd.<br> <br>The music shifts to some dirty hip-hop beats, and soon I&#x2019;m surrounded by skin and sweat and heat, a mass of bodies moving in a slow, grinding pulse. Elise keeps hold of me, dancing and posing, pulling me into it, until my self-consciousness drifts away and I&#x2019;m as lost in the music as she is. Every party, every dance floor, every illegal warehouse rave is the same: once I&#x2019;m past that first, awkward moment, once Elise has dragged me into it&#x2014;out of myself&#x2014;it&#x2019;s like nothing else. I&#x2019;m not Anna, I&#x2019;m not me anymore; I&#x2019;m something beyond, my heart racing as the songs melt into each other, and all that matters is the beat and their bodies, and that bass, pounding on.<br> <br>Breathless, I let my body go, let it move and sway, caught up. Tate brings me tight against him, and then it&#x2019;s the three of us, me and Elise dancing up close to him and spinning away; green strobe lights cutting through the dark. Tate laughs between us, his hands lingering on Elise&#x2019;s waist as she grinds against him. The spotlights strobe across his face, the beautiful angles of his jaw, and suddenly I want him with a fierce ache in my chest. Mine. I grab his hand away from her, pulling him wordlessly to the edge of the dance floor, my back finding some solid surface, his hands finding the curve of my hips, his lips finding mine.<br> <br>He leans in to kiss me, pushing me hard up against the wall. I wrap my arms around his neck, pulling him down, locking him against me as our mouths hungrily roam over lips and skin and shoulders. I wish I could stay like this forever&#x2014;the tightrope wire between drunk and sober, between flesh-and-blood and free. Then the music changes again, something pulsating and euphoric, and we&#x2019;re back on the floor, dancing. I don&#x2019;t know how long we&#x2019;ve been out there when Elise yanks me away. &#x201c;Bathroom break!&#x201d; she orders, collecting Chelsea and Mel from their spot by the DJ booth.<br> <br>We girls spill into the tiny bathroom, scattering lip gloss and mascara on the countertop, crowding around the cracked mirror. &#x201c;So, who&#x2019;s in for some skinny-dipping?&#x201d; Elise hops up by the sink and swings her heels against the cabinet. She fixes me with a mischievous grin. &#x201c;What do you say, like that time in Walden Pond?&#x201d;<br> <br>I laugh. &#x201c;Yeah, and we nearly died of hypothermia.&#x201d;<br> <br>Elise shrugs, unconcerned. &#x201c;So it&#x2019;s a good thing we&#x2019;re in the Caribbean now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not serious?&#x201d; Mel blinks from under her blunt-cut black bangs. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s pitch-black out there; you&#x2019;d drown.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;ll find a cute Aruba lifeguard to come protect me.&#x201d; Elise carefully pouts, applying another layer of pink lip stain.<br> <br>&#x201c;Or cut you into tiny pieces and feed you to the sharks,&#x201d; Mel mutters. She tugs at the hem of the skirt we had to talk her into, trying in vain to yank it an extra inch down over her pale thighs. I feel a stab of irritation at her whining. Typical Mel&#x2014;always acting like a chaperone even when the rest of us are having fun. Straight A&#x2019;s, future med student: she wants everything to run on a strict plan. Her plan.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lighten up.&#x201d; I sigh. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not still pissed about the room thing?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a room,&#x201d; Mel complains. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s, like, a closet with a pullout bed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You could share with AK and my brother,&#x201d; Chelsea calls from inside the tiny cubicle. There&#x2019;s a flush, and she emerges, finger-combing her long, salt-bleached hair. She barely glances at her reflection, barefaced with her dusting of freckles. But then, she doesn&#x2019;t need to. Chelsea has that whole natural, beach beauty thing down cold. Even during icy Boston winters, she always manages to look like she just strolled in from a surfing session in the sun. &#x201c;Although,&#x201d; she adds with a smirk, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ll have to deal with all their gross boy underwear lying around.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not the only thing they&#x2019;re trying to lay,&#x201d; I quip. Elise laughs, and high-fives me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe they&#x2019;ll let you watch,&#x201d; she adds to Mel. &#x201c;You might learn something.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;La, la, la!&#x201d; Chelsea protests, covering her ears. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the rule?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No talking about your brother and his sex life.&#x201d; Elise sighs.<br> <br>&#x201c;Or his lack of one.&#x201d; I grin, but Mel is still sulking. She turns to Elise.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why I can&#x2019;t just share with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because I plan on having fun.&#x201d; Elise smiles. &#x201c;Like with that blond guy, the one in the VIP booth.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They have a VIP booth here?&#x201d; Chelsea laughs, trying to rinse her hands under the sputtering tap. Her wrists are full of knotted yarn bracelets and exotic beads, fraying until they&#x2019;re barely hanging on. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t even have running water.&#x201d;<br> <br>Elise just applies a coat of gloss red lip balm. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s cute, I&#x2019;m telling you. I think I&#x2019;ll have him come back to see the house. The view from my bedroom&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She winks.<br> <br>&#x201c;Elise!&#x201d; Mel protests, like clockwork, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t even know him. He could be a rapist, or murderer, or&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop with all the buzzkill,&#x201d; I interrupt.<br> <br>&#x201c;You need a drink,&#x201d; Elise agrees. She hops down and links her arm with Mel&#x2019;s, giving me an exasperated look over her head. &#x201c;Two drinks. And a hot, sweaty local guy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Interested, we know.&#x201d; Elise steers her out, back into the club. <br> <br>We chorus in unison, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not that kind of girl.&#x201d;<br> <br>Melanie pouts. &#x201c;You say it like it&#x2019;s a bad thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>Elise rolls her eyes. &#x201c;No, we say it like it&#x2019;s a dull thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>Back on the floor, Elise points out her target for the night. He&#x2019;s lounging with some buddies in the corner: he&#x2019;s handsome, in his early twenties maybe, with a bored nonchalance that just screams rich kid.<br> <br>&#x201c;Cute, right?&#x201d; She grinds against me, flashing flirtatious looks over at the guy, pulling me in to nuzzle at my neck.<br> <br>I laugh. &#x201c;He looks like trouble.&#x201d;<br> <br>She grins back. &#x201c;Just the way I like them.&#x201d; And then she&#x2019;s gone, ducking through the crowd toward the guy. I watch her go. Within seconds, she&#x2019;s smiling and laughing with the group, that one guy giving her an approving grin.<br> <br>Tate reappears next to me. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Elise?&#x201d; he yells to be heard.<br> <br>I shrug vaguely, but Tate looks across the floor to where she&#x2019;s already angled, cross-legged in the booth with them, leaning in to talk to her prospective conquest. Her hair glows purple and red under the lights, tanned legs long and bare under her skirt. I smile, watching her at work. She&#x2019;s gorgeous; no man would stand a chance of resisting.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like this. We should stick together,&#x201d; he yells again, frowning.<br> <br>&#x201c;Relax!&#x201d; I slide my arms around him, pulling his lips down to mine. &#x201c;Elise is a big girl. She can take care of herself.&#x201d;</p><h2>Handbook for Bible Teachers and Preachers</h2><p>The author maintains that the central message of each book of the Bible must be familiar and thoroughly understood before a teacher or preacher can effectively interpret its message.

Ted Hope, whose films have garnered 12 Oscar nominations, draws from his own personal experiences working on the early films of Ang Lee, Eddie Burns, Hal Hartley, Michel Gondry, Nicole Holofcener, Todd Solondz and other indie mavericks, relating those decisions that brought him success as well as the occasional failure.<br><br>Whether navigating negotiations with Harvey Weinstein over final cuts or clashing with high-powered CAA agents over their clients, Hope offers behind-the-scenes stories from the wild and often heated world of low-budget cinema where art and commerce collide. As mediator between these two opposing interests, Hope offers his unique perspective on how to make movies while keeping your integrity intact and how to create a sustainable business enterprise out of that art while staying true to yourself. Against a backdrop of seismic changes in the indie-film industry, from corporate co-option to the rise of social media, <i>Hope for Film</i> provides not only an entertaining and intimate ride through the ups and downs of the business of art-house movies over the last 25 years, but also hope for its future.</p><p><b>Ted Hope</b> is one of the most respected voices in independent film.

In September 2012, Hope left a lifetime in New York City to take leadership of the San Francisco Film Society as Executive Director, where he is providing a launchpad for film lovers and filmmakers to participate in the broadest definition of cinema by creating innovative programs for the creation, appreciation and monetization of the art form. He is also an exciting and prolific voice on Twitter with over 30,000 followers, and has contributed to numerous publications, including <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>Filmmaker Magazine. </i>It was January 1991 and bitterly cold. Why in the hell were we out on the streets of New York City shooting a movie? The U.S. military had just launched its massive air campaign in Iraq. The nightly infrared news images of the bombing of Baghdad looked a bit like the high contrast black-and-white film stock we were using on the film that had brought us together, a short called Keep it For Yourself.&#x201d; Directed by French filmmaker Claire Denis, it was my first project for the film company, Good Machine that I had just co-founded with James Schamus.<br><br>Our office was above one of the strip clubs on Warren Street in Tribeca. My longtime girlfriend and I had split up and I was through with silly things like romance. There was only one thing I wanted to do: work, work, work. I should have been in heaven, but the production was going horribly wrong. The crew didn&#x2019;t trust Claire or her cinematographer Agnes Godard they were insisting on shooting in chronological script order to help the nonprofessional actors reach a level of emotional truth. What is good for the actors can be something else for the crew and jumping back and forth across the room with your camera is not considered the most efficient way to shoot a movie. Who are these European rank amateurs?&#x201d; the crew was saying. They were threatening mutiny. Then light streaks kept mysteriously showing up on the exposed film stock unbeknownst to us at the time, because it was thirty degrees, the celluloid was conducting static electricity. In order to continue, the camera crew was nestling the film stock in their down jackets or putting hot water bottles around the film magazines.</p><h2>A Cajun Christmas Killing: A Cajun Country Mystery</h2><p>Maggie Crozat is back home in bayou country during the most magical time of the year.

This book provides an account of the movement that spread through Europe and the US. Biographies of over 300 designers are included, with a guide to identification, from the elegance of the French masters - Vever, Lalique and Fouquet - to the linear, geometric designs of the Viennese - Josef Hoffmann and Koloman Moser.</strong></p> Jewelry was one of the purest, and most successful, expressions of the Art Nouveau movement. It captured the atmosphere and the passion of the fin de siAcle, as well as the moral and artistic freedom that characterized the period. Fresh designs and motifs were created with an intense excitement that was shared by artists all over the world. Sensuous animal and plant forms surged with new life; the female form struggled toward a new freedom, suggesting a long-hidden eroticism; and sunsets and changing seasons reflected the symbolic view of art in nature borrowed from the Japanese.

Instead, he found Chavez Ravine, a ramshackle Mexican-American neighborhood tucked away in Elysian Park like a poor man s Shangri-la. Enchanted, he stayed for a year amidst the wild roses, tin roofs, and wandering goats of this uniquely intact rural community on the city s outskirts. Accepted by the residents, Normark was able to photo-graph a life that, though bowed down by poverty, was lived fully, openly, and joyfully. That ended in 1950, when the residents of Chavez Ravine received letters from the government directing them to sell their homes and leave. Some sold, some were dragged out of their houses kicking and screaming. The emptied houses were razed to make way for Dodger Stadium. The past fifty years have not erased the memories of Los Desterrados, the uprooted descendents of Chavez Ravine. Now available in paperback, this beautiful, haunting book captures their images, their stories, and their bittersweet memories. A social and cultural history of Los Angeles and Mexican America, Chavez Ravine reclaims and celebrates this lost village from a simpler time.</p><p>Don Normark has had more than ten thousand photographs published in Sunset and other magazines.

Tickets are in such demand that even the waiting list is closed, and players value the title above all others. In <em>Making the Masters</em>, award-winning golf writer David Barrett focuses his attention on how the Masters was conceived, how it got off the ground in 1934, and how it fully established itself in 1935.&nbsp;<p>The key figure in the tournament&#x2019;s creation and success was Bobby Jones, who was a living legend after winning the Grand Slam in 1930 and immediately retiring at the age of twenty-eight. He went on to found Augusta National and sought a high-profile tournament for his new course. But nearly as important was Clifford Roberts, a banker friend of Jones who not only embraced Jones&#x2019;s vision but became his right-hand man in working to bring that vision to reality.&nbsp;</p><p>Barrett explores how Jones and Roberts built the Masters from scratch, creating a golf institution embellished by the often surprising details of what that entailed as they were trying to establish a golf club and golf tournament in tough economic times. It also vividly chronicles the events of the 1934 and 1935 Masters, with Gene Sarazen&#x2019;s spectacular victory in 1935 providing the climax. Set against the backdrop of golf, and America, in the 1930s, the book provides an informative and entertaining read for fans of the Masters and students of golf history.</p></p><p><strong>David Barrett</strong> has been a professional golf writer for more than thirty years.

The war it had declared against Great Britain two years earlier appeared headed toward inglorious American defeat. The young nation&#x2019;s most implacable nemesis, the ruthless British Admiral George Cockburn, launched an invasion of Washington in a daring attempt to decapitate the government and crush the American spirit. The British succeeded spectacularly, burning down most of the city&#x2019;s landmarks&#x2014;including the White House and the Capitol&#x2014;and driving President James Madison from the area. As looters ransacked federal buildings and panic gripped the citizens of Washington, beleaguered American forces were forced to regroup for a last-ditch defense of Baltimore. The outcome of that &#x201c;perilous fight&#x201d; would help change the outcome of the war&#x2014;and with it, the fate of the fledgling American republic.<br> &nbsp;<br> In a fast-paced, character-driven narrative, Steve Vogel tells the story of this titanic struggle from the perspective of both sides. Like an epic novel, <i>Through the Perilous Fight</i> abounds with heroes, villains, and astounding feats of derring-do. The vindictive Cockburn emerges from these pages as a pioneer in the art of total warfare, ordering his men to &#x201c;knock down, burn, and destroy&#x201d; everything in their path. While President Madison dithers on how to protect the capital, Secretary of State James Monroe personally organizes the American defenses, with disastrous results. Meanwhile, a prominent Washington lawyer named Francis Scott Key embarks on a mission of mercy to negotiate the release of an American prisoner. His journey will place him with the British fleet during the climactic Battle for Baltimore, and culminate in the creation of one of the most enduring compositions in the annals of patriotic song: &#x201c;The Star-Spangled Banner.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Like Pearl Harbor or 9/11, the burning of Washington was a devastating national tragedy that ultimately united America and renewed its sense of purpose. <i>Through the Perilous Fight</i> combines bravura storytelling with brilliantly rendered character sketches to recreate the thrilling six-week period when Americans rallied from the ashes to overcome their oldest adversary&#x2014;and win themselves a new birth of freedom.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Through the Perilous Fight<br></i></b><br>&#x201c;Very fine storytelling, impeccably researched . . . brings to life the fraught events of 1814 with compelling and convincing vigor.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Rick Atkinson, Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author of <i>An Army at Dawn</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Probably the best piece of military history that I have read or reviewed in the past five years. . . .

The river was at its widest here, three miles from shore to shore where its water fl owed lazily into the &nbsp;Chesapeake Bay. The sultry August weather had turned cool overnight, and the day was refreshingly crisp. Even from a distance it was easy to spot HMS <i>Albion</i>, anchored along the far Virginia shore. The 74&#x2013; gun frigate, weighing nearly 1,700 tons and manned by a crew of 620, was one of the largest and most powerful British warships ever seen in these waters, and it was accompanied by nearly two dozen brigs, sloops, and tenders. More daunting than the ships and weaponry was the man the agent had come to see: Rear Admiral George Cockburn. The &#x201c;Great Bandit,&#x201d; as the papers called him, was the most hated man in the United States, and the most feared. Americans compared him to notorious barbarians of ancient times, among them Attila the Hun.<br> &nbsp;<br> For more than a year, the British squadron commander had waged a campaign of terror along the Chesapeake Bay, sacking Havre de Grace, Maryland, at the mouth of the Susquehanna, ravaging Hampton, plundering the Virginia shoreline, and torching farms in Maryland, acts that had infuriated Americans. Ruthless, witty, and swashbuckling, the lowlands Scot was determined to make Americans pay a hard price for their ill- considered war with Great Britain.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;[T]here breathes not in any quarter of the globe a more savage monster than this same British Admiral,&#x201d; the Boston <i>Gazette </i>declared. &#x201c;He is a disgrace to England and to human nature.&#x201d; A Fourth of July celebration in Talbot County, Maryland, included a toast to Cockburn, &#x201c;a man in person but a brute in principle; may the Chesapeake be his watery grave.&#x201d; One irate Virginian had offered a thousand dollars for the admiral&#x2019;s head or &#x201c;five hundred dollars for each of his ears, on delivery.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Skinner had sailed from Baltimore on August 7, 1814, bearing official dispatches for the British. As the government&#x2019;s designated prisoner of war agent, Skinner was a veteran of many such missions, routinely carrying communications from Washington or negotiating prisoner exchanges. He was as familiar as anyone in America with Cockburn and his depredations. Just three weeks previously, the British had burned the Maryland plantation in Prince Frederick where Skinner had been born, and earlier in the summer, they had torched his barn and property at nearby St. Leonard. But if he held a grudge, Skinner was too savvy to make it known to Cockburn.<br> As usual, Skinner was courteously welcomed aboard <i>Albion</i>. For all of Cockburn&#x2019;s haughty bombast and undisputed ruthlessness, Skinner had found him to be a gracious host, always seating Skinner for a meal at the admiral&#x2019;s table and ready &#x201c;to mitigate the rigors of war&#x201d; with hospitality. Skinner had a rough- and- tumble personality to match his pugilistic face, as well as an innate candor, all of which Cockburn appreciated.<br> &nbsp;<br> The admiral, his Scottish complexion reddened by the relentless Chesapeake sun, was in a good mood, having just completed a series of successful raids that had terrified residents along the Potomac shores of Virginia&#x2019;s Northern Neck. At 2 a.m. on August 3, Cockburn had headed up the Yeocomico River, probing the inlet off the Potomac with a force of 500 sailors and Royal Marines in twenty barges. Among them, dressed in red coats, were a special company of 120 Colonial Marines&#x2014; slaves who had escaped to the British from plantations in Virginia and Maryland, and trained to fight their former masters. Their use was a particularly brilliant and insidious stroke, unleashing deep seated fears among the locals of a slave revolt.<br> &nbsp;<br> A Virginia militia artillery company waiting at Mundy&#x2019;s Point fired on the British with six- pounder cannons, and the first shot beheaded a Royal Marine in the lead boat. But the Virginians soon ran low on ammunition, and the British swarmed ashore. Major Pemberton Claughton, a Virginia militia commander, was shocked to see a slave who had escaped from his plantation among the invaders. The admiral and his &#x201c;gallant band&#x201d; chased the retreating Americans ten miles almost at a run, burning every house they passed, including Major Claughton&#x2019;s home. Finally, the raiding party collapsed on the ground, exhausted in the 90- degree heat. But there was no time for rest&#x2014; Cockburn learned that the Virginia militia was regrouping at the nearby village of Kinsale.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What! Englishmen tired with a fine morning&#x2019;s walk like this,&#x201d; cried Cockburn. &#x201c;Here, give me your musket; here, yours, my man. Your admiral will carry them for you.&#x201d; He placed a musket on each shoulder and began marching, rousing the men.<br> &nbsp;<br> Returning to their boats, the British sailed to Kinsale, opened fire on the town, and scattered the militia. The village was burned and some thirty homes destroyed. A dead Virginia militiaman was dragged out, his pockets turned inside out and rifled. The British carried off five captured schooners brimming with hogsheads of tobacco, five prisoners, a field gun, and two horses belonging to a militia commander and his son.<br> &nbsp;<br> Spreading fear was Cockburn&#x2019;s mission, and the sack of Kinsale had served this goal quite well. Back on the ships, Cockburn was even more pleased by the news brought to him August 7 by two British frigates, freshly arrived in the Potomac from Bermuda: Troopships carrying 4,000 battle- hardened British army soldiers would soon sail into the Chesapeake.<br> &nbsp;<br> Captain Robert Rowley, commander of one of the squadron&#x2019;s ships, mused about the news in a letter home to England. &#x201c;I suppose some grand attack will be meditated,&#x201d; he wrote. A grand attack was precisely what Cockburn had in mind.<br> &nbsp;<br> Three weeks earlier, on July 17, Cockburn had submitted a secret plan to capture the capital of the United States. All he needed were army troops that he could bring up the Patuxent River, a Maryland tributary of the Chesapeake providing a back route to Washington. &#x201c;Within forty- eight hours after arrival in the Patuxent of such a force, the city of Washington might be possessed without difficulty or opposition of any kind,&#x201d; Cockburn had written to Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, the fleet commander, then in Bermuda assembling reinforcements.<br> &nbsp;<br> The British invasion of the Chesapeake was meant to force the United States to divert troops it had sent to attack British colonies in Canada. But Cockburn saw the possibility for more. The fall of the American capital could be the strategic blow that brought Britain victory. The government of James Madison, or &#x201c;Jemmy,&#x201d; as Cockburn contemptuously called the five- foot, four- inch president, would be scattered and disgraced, and perhaps even fall. &#x201c;It is quite impossible for any country to be in a more unfit state for war than this now is,&#x201d; he told Cochrane. Even if the Americans learned every detail of the British plan of attack, Cockburn added, they were too weak to &#x201c;avert the blow.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Now in its third year, America&#x2019;s war with Great Britain was about to take a dangerous turn for the United States.<br> &nbsp;<br> The War of 1812 was an outgrowth of the titanic struggle that had raged between England and France almost continuously since 1793, when the French Revolutionary government declared war on Great Britain. That conflict had only grown more desperate with the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte as emperor of France and his dominance over much of Europe by 1811. Fighting in their mind for England&#x2019;s survival&#x2014; and even the survival of civilization&#x2014; the British never hesitated to trample on American sovereignty to support the war&#x2019;s ends. They seized American sailors of suspected British origin to man Royal Navy ships, and they severely restricted U.S. trade with Europe. <br> &nbsp;<br> One generation removed from the revolutionary War, the United States seethed with resentment against her former colonial master. For many Americans in 1812, the belief was strong that the revolution was not complete, that the United States had won its freedom, but not its independence. Bowing to the arrogant British behavior would leave Americans &#x201c;not an <br> independent people, but colonists and vassals,&#x201d; President Madison believed. In Congress, the war hawks&#x2014; an aptly named band of representatives from the South and West&#x2014; were eager to see North America cleared of the British, allowing unimpeded expansion to the west, and, some hoped, to the north. In June 1812, a bitterly divided Congress, split on both party and geographic lines, had narrowly agreed to declare war.<br> &nbsp;<br> Already fighting a war in Europe, Britain had not sought the conflict with America. But it had no interest in allowing the United States unfettered sovereignty, nor did it wish to cede any measure of control in North America. The Americans and the Loyalists who had moved across the border into Canadian territory after the American Revolution had competing visions for the future of the North American continent, neither involving the other.<br> &nbsp;<br> The American war against one of the world&#x2019;s great powers had gone badly from the start for the United States and its small, unprepared military forces. Multiple invasions of the British colonies of Upper and Lower Canada had ended in humiliating failure in 1812 and 1813.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now, driven by events across the ocean, 1814 was shaping up to be the darkest year in the young nation&#x2019;s history. Napoleon&#x2019;s abdication of power in April appeared to have ended two decades of hostilities in Europe. The British had been left in a commanding position to end the festering war in North America. Troops from the Duke of Wellington&#x2019;s victorious army were being sent across the ocean to punish America for its treachery, and to force a humiliating peace on the country. The United States, its military forces spread thin, its economy in ruins, and its people bitterly divided by the war, was ripe for defeat. The American experiment was in danger of dying in its infancy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Walking the deck of <i>Albion</i>, Cockburn chatted amiably with Skinner. Cockburn handed the American agent a dispatch for Secretary of State James Monroe and a message for the Russian minister in Washington. As a courtesy, he also passed along a bundle of the latest English newspapers, though the most recent was already more than two months old. Skinner brought Cockburn news of &#x201c;severe&#x201d; fighting in July on the Niagara frontier between the United States and Canada, where American and British armies at Chippewa and Lundy&#x2019;s Lane had clashed in the bloodiest battles the war had yet seen. <br> &nbsp;<br> They spoke about peace negotiations in the Flemish city of Ghent, where ministers from the United States and Britain had just convened. Few held much hope for peace. Cockburn knew all the British commissioners and complained to Skinner that they were a decidedly mediocre lot. The admiral posed a question: What did the American ministers think of the prospects for peace? Skinner replied that there had been no recent word from them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cockburn could not resist smiling as he replied. The admiral was well aware that his words would soon make their way back to Washington, and almost certainly to the president himself.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I believe, Mr. Skinner, that Mr. Madison will have to put on his armor and fight it out,&#x201d; Cockburn said. &#x201c;I see nothing else left.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> CHAPTER 1<br> <i>How Do You Like the War Now?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Terra Rubra, Maryland, Wednesday, August 10, 1814<br> &nbsp;<br> The complacency in Washington bothered Francis Scott Key as much as anything. On August 10, the thirty- four- year- old attorney took up his pen to write his closest friend, John Randolph of Roanoke. The brilliant but eccentric congressman had retreated in self-imposed exile to his cabin in south- central Virginia after his efforts to avert war with England had failed and voters had tossed him out of office for his troubles. Key often wrote his brooding friend, keeping him abreast of developments in Washington.<br> &nbsp;<br> Though the administration of President James Madison had mobilized over the summer to protect Washington against the British threat, Key was painfully aware that little, in fact, had been done. &#x201c;The government seem to be under little or no expectation of an attack upon the city,&#x201d; Key wrote to Randolph. &#x201c;With the present force of the enemy there is no danger; but if they are considerably reinforced, and we not better prepared, the approaching Congress may have more to do than to talk.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Key was at his parents&#x2019; farm at Terra Rubra, in the rolling hills of central Maryland, where he always retreated with his wife and children to escape the suffocating heat of Washington in summer. After a half- dozen years practicing law from his Georgetown office, Key had established himself as one of the foremost attorneys in the capital. But business always grew slow in summer, more so than ever this year, with the threat of Cockburn and the British on the horizon.<br> &nbsp;<br> Slender and of medium height, with a wiry frame and a slight stoop, Key had a mop of dark brown curly hair atop his handsome face, with an aquiline nose and deep- set blue eyes. His face often bore a pensive expression &#x201c;almost bordering on sadness,&#x201d; according to a contemporary, &#x201c;but which, in moments of special excitement . . . gave place to a bright ethereality of aspect and a noble audacity of tone and gesture which pleased while it dazzled the beholder.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Key&#x2019;s court oratory was attracting attention, as much for his style and charisma as for any legal brilliance. His language was beautiful, his voice sonorous, and his enunciation impeccable. But what people noticed most was the passion&#x2014; &#x201c;like lightning charging his sentences with electrical power,&#x201d; a courtroom observer would say.<br> &nbsp;<br> Randolph&#x2019;s last letter to Key had expressed hope that peace might be in the offing, but the latter did not share his optimism. &#x201c;I do not think (as you seem to do) that our labours are nearly over&#x2014; I do not believe we shall have peace,&#x201d; Key wrote. &#x201c;England will not treat with us but on high &amp; haughty terms.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Before posting his letter, Key added a postscript with disturbing news about the British: &#x201c;I have just read intelligence of the arrival of this formidable reinforcement &amp; am preparing to set out for Geo Town in the morning&#x2014; I fear we are little prepared for it.&#x201d;</p><h2>The First Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever: Lord Foul&#39;s Bane; The Illearth War; The Power That Preserves</h2><p>This complete &#34;Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever&#34; contains the books &#34;Lord Foul&#39;s Bane&#34;, &#34;The Illearth War&#34; and &#34;The Power that Preserves&#34;. The first chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever is a fantasy series written by Stephen Donaldson. The series follows the principle character of Thomas Covenant who is a disillusioned, bitter and very cynical writer afflicted with leprosy. Shunned by society, Thomas is hit by a car and awakes in a strange alternate world full of strange creatures and magic. Truly an original creation, The First Chronicles of Thomas Covenant is a truly classic trilogy that ranks alongside Tolkien. Literary Awards: British Fantasy Award for Best Novel (1979), World Fantasy Award Nominee for Best Novel (1978)</p><p>Stephen Donaldson was born in 1947 in Cleveland, Ohio. Between the ages of three and sixteen he lived in India, where his father, an orthopaedic surgeon, worked with leprosy sufferers. This inspired his fictional character, Thomas Covenant. Donaldson served two years as a conscientious objector doing hospital work in Akron, then attended Kent State University, where he received his M.A. in English in 1971. He now lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p><h2>The Contender: The Story of Marlon Brando</h2><p><p>The award-winning film biographer presents a deeply-textured, ambitious, and definitive portrait of the greatest movie actor of the twentieth century, the elusive Marlon Brando, bringing his extraordinarily complex life into view as never before.<br><br>The most influential movie actor of his era, Marlon Brando changed the way other actors perceived their craft. His approach was natural, honest, and deeply personal, resulting in performances&#x2014;most notably in <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em> and <em>On the Waterfront</em>&#x2014;that are without parallel. Brando was heralded as the American Hamlet&#x2014;the Yank who surpassed British stage royalty Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud, and Ralph Richardson as the standard of greatness in the mid-twentieth century. </p><p>Brando&#x2019;s impact on American culture matches his professional significance; he both challenged and codified our ideas of masculinity and sexuality. Brando was also one of the first stars to use his fame as a platform to address social, political, and moral issues, courageously calling out America&#x2019;s deeply rooted racism.</p><p>William Mann&#x2019;s brilliant biography of the Hollywood legend illuminates this culture icon for a new age. Mann astutely argues that Brando was not only a great actor but also a cultural soothsayer, a Cassandra warning us about the challenges to come. Brando&#x2019;s admonitions against the monetization of nearly every aspect of the culture were prescient. His public protests against racial segregation and discrimination at the height of the Civil Rights movement&#x2014;getting himself arrested at least once&#x2014;were criticized as being needlessly provocative. Yet those actions of fifty years ago have become a model many actors follow today.</p><p>Psychologically astute and masterfully researched, based on new and revelatory material, <em>The Contender</em> explores the star and the man in full, including the childhood traumas that reverberated through his professional and personal life. It is a dazzling biography of our nation&#x2019;s greatest actor that is sure to become an instant classic.</p><p><em>The Contender</em> includes sixteen pages of photographs.</p></p><p><p>William J. Mann is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Kate: The Woman Who Was Hepburn</em>; <em>How to Be a Movie Star: Elizabeth Taylor in Hollywood</em>; <em>Hello, Gorgeous: Becoming Barbra Streisand</em>; and <em>Wisecracker: The Life and Times of William Haines</em>, winner of the Lambda Literary Award. He divides his time between Connecticut and Cape Cod.</p>&#x201c;An insightful and well-researched portrait of Marlon Brando. Taking a cinematic approach, Mann swoops in on pivotal moments in Brando&#x2019;s life.&nbsp;Though sympathetic to Brando, Mann doesn&#x2019;t shy away from his flaws, such as his often callous treatment of women. The result is a thoughtfully considered study of a supremely talented, observant, and imaginative man who became a reluctant cultural icon.&#x201d; (Publishers Weekly <strong>(starred review)</strong>)<br><br>&#x201c;In this meticulously researched book, bolstered by access to the Brando estate, Mann &#x201c;attempts to see Brando&#x2019;s life, career, choices, and actions in a new light.&#x201d; The author describes him as a &#x201c;thinker, an observer, an examiner of himself and the world, with the goal of figuring out both.&#x201d; He sympathetically portrays Brando as a survivor of childhood trauma, the only son of alcoholic parents: an abusive father and a distant, neglectful mother Brando loved dearly. Throughout, Mann balances Brando&#x2019;s reluctance to act with excellent insights into his finest performances. A complex, intimate, and illuminating inquiry into and defense of Brando.&#x201d; (Kirkus Reviews)</p><h2>Native American Legends: Southeastern Legends -- Tales from the Natchez, Caddo, Biloxi, Chickasaw, and Other Nations (American Folklore Series)</h2><p>Lankford&#39;s comprehensive anthology is a testament to his homage of native Americans and their history.

A complete exposition of how Christ prepared His twelve disciples. (20040603)</p><p>With many ministers and religious organizations already using modern techniques found in management books, why not go straight to the source? A. B. Bruce's 1877 work The Training of the Twelve shows the methods Jesus used to lead his disciples and teach them to spread His Word. <p>Though written more than a century ago (and based on Gospels two thousand years old), the ideas in this volume apply as surely today as they did in 1877, and church leaders (or those aspiring to be church leaders) will find this an invaluable resource. </p><p>Learn... <br>* how Jesus chose and trained his disciples <br>* how and what he taught them about evangelism and prayer <br>* the nature of true holiness <br>* humility and self-sacrifice <br>* and much more.</p>Alexander Balmain Bruce (1831&#x2013;1899) was a Scottish churchman and theologian. He was a minister of the Free Church of Scotland. He was born at Aberargie near Perth, Scotland. His father suffered for his adherence to the Free Church at the Disruption of 1843, and moved to Edinburgh, where Alexander was educated, showing exceptional ability from the first. His early religious doubts, awakened especially by David Strauss's Life of Jesus, made him throughout life sympathetic with those who underwent a similar stress. After serving as assistant first at Ancrum, then at Lochwinnoch, he was called to Cardross in Dumbartonshire (now Dunbartonshire) in 1859, and to Broughty Ferry in 1868. There he published his first notable exegetical work, the Training of the Twelve. In 1874 he delivered his Cunningham Lectures, afterwards published as The Humiliation of Christ, and in the following year was appointed to the chair of Apologetics and New Testament exegesis at the Free Church College, Glasgow, a post he held for twenty-four years. He was one of the first British New Testament scholars whose work was received favourably in Germany. The character and work of Christ were, he held, the ultimate proof and the best defence of Christianity; and his tendency was to concentrate attention somewhat narrowly on the historic Jesus. In The Kingdom of God (1889), which first encountered serious hostile criticism in his own communion, he accounted for some of the differences between the first and third evangelists on the principle of accommodation--maintaining that Saint Luke had altered both the text and the spirit of his sources to suit the needs of those for whom he wrote. It was held that these admissions were not consistent with the views of inspiration professed by the Free Church of Scotland. When the case was tried, the assembly held that the charge of heresy was based on a misunderstanding, but that by want of due care in his mode of statement he had given some ground for the painful impressions which had existed. Bruce rendered great service to his own communion in connection with its service of praise. He was convener of the committee which issued the Free Church hymn book, and he threw into this work the same energy and catholicity of mind which marked the rest of his activities.</p><h2>Wings That Shine (Enchanted Pony Academy #2) (2)</h2><p>Welcome to the Enchanted Pony Academy, where glittery ponies learn how to use their magic!<br>Skydancer can talk to any animal with wings -- a very useful Glitter Gift, and one she's always enjoyed (having your mane braided by birds is fun!).<br>But when she stumbles upon a dragon at the edge of the Enchanted Pony Academy grounds, Skydancer is terrified.

With more than 300 photographs and 50 maps, Night Trains is a lively account of the Pullman enterprise during the golden years of its operation--from 1920 to 1955--when the remarkable sleeping car system routinely played host to more than 50,000 guests nightly.</p><p>"A compelling tribute to a bygone time when getting there was half the fun...

This is the first comprehensive geographic study of the lines served by Pullman cars in the United States (a line is here defined as a car scheduled to run regularly between two stations, whether in one train or several). Most lines connected large cities, but before tourist travel was lost to the automobile one could have ridden a through sleeper, at least seasonally, on such unlikely lines as Washington, D.C.-Oquossoc, Me.

This compellingly written &#39;detective story&#39; puts forward the most convincing explanation yet proposed for the origins of image-making and art, examining how the Neanderthals lived for over 10,000 years alongside our Cro-Magnon ancestors, but never developed art. The reason for this lay in the evolution of the human mind. Cro-Magnons possessed a higher-order consciousness and more advanced neurological make-up, which enabled them to experience shamanistic trances and vivid mental imagery. It became important for them to &#39;fix&#39;, or paint, these images on to cave walls, which they perceived as the membrane between their world and the spirit world from which the visions came. These illuminating glimpses into the ancient mind are skilfully interwoven with the story of modern-day cave discoveries and vivid descriptions of the beautiful Ice-Age art found in caves such as Lascaux and Altamira.</p><p>`You will refer back to these precious books again and again' <br>David Lewis-Williams is Professor Emeritus and Senior Mentor in the Rock Art Research Institute, University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg.

Even without snow or wind the damp winter air permeated Peter&#x2019;s topcoat and settled in his bones as he stood outside one of the dozens of bookshops that crowded the narrow streets of Hay. Despite the warm glow in the window that illuminated a tantalizing display of Victorian novels, Peter was in no hurry to open the door. It had been nine months since he had entered a bookshop; another few minutes wouldn&#x2019;t make a difference. There had been a time when this was all so familiar, so safe; when stepping into a rare bookshop had been a moment of excitement, meeting a fellow book lover a part of a grand adventure.</p><p>Peter Byerly was, after all, a bookseller. It was the profession that had brought him to England again and again, and the profession that brought him to Hay-on-Wye, the famous town of books just over the border in Wales, on this dreary afternoon. He had visited Hay many times before, but today was the first time he had ever come alone.</p><p>Now, as the cold ache in his extremities crept toward his core, he saw not a grand adventure but only an uncomfortable setting, a stranger, and the potential for shyness and unease to descend into anxiety and panic. Anticipation brought cold sweat to the back of his neck. Why had he come? He could be safe in his sitting room with a cup of tea right now instead of standing on a cold street corner with a sense of dread settling into the pit of his stomach.</p><p>Before he could change his mind, he forced himself to grasp the door handle and in another second he was stepping into what should have been welcoming warmth.</p><p>&#x201c;Afternoon,&#x201d; said a crisp voice through a haze of pipe smoke that hovered over a wide desk. Peter mumbled a few syllables, then slipped through an open doorway into the back room, where books lined every wall. He closed his eyes for a moment, imagining the cocoon of books shielding him from all danger, inhaling deeply that familiar scent of cloth and leather and dust and words. His rushing pulse began to slow, and when he opened his eyes he scanned the shelves for something familiar&#x2014;a title, an author, a well-remembered dust jacket design&#x2014;anything that might ground him in the world of the known.</p><p>Just above eye level, he spotted a binding of beautiful blue leather that reminded him of the calf he had used to bind another book&#x2014;could it have been nearly ten years ago? He pulled the book from the shelf, reveling in the smooth, luxurious feel of the leather. Taking a closer look at the gold stamping on the spine, Peter smiled. He knew this book. If not an old friend, it was certainly an acquaintance, and the prospect of spending a few minutes between its covers calmed his nerves.</p><p><i>An Inquiry into the Authenticity of Certain Miscellaneous Papers, </i>by Edmond Malone, was a monument of analysis that unmasked one of the great forgers of all time, William Henry Ireland. Ireland had forged documents and letters purporting to be written by William Shakespeare, and even the &#x201c;original manuscripts&#x201d; of <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>King</i> <i>Lear</i>. Peter turned past the marbled endpapers to the title page: it was a copy of the first edition of 1796. He loved the feel of heavy eighteenth-century paper between his fingers, the texture of the indentations made on the page by the letterpress. He flipped a few pages and read:</p><p>It has been said that every individual of this country, whose mind has been at all cultivated, feels a pride in being able to boast of our own great dramatick poet, Shakespeare, as his countryman: and proportionate to our respect and veneration for that extraordinary man ought to be our care of his fame, and of those valuable writings he left us.</p><p>Peter smiled as he recalled reading &#x201c;those valuable writings&#x201d; from an actual copy of the First Folio, that weighty 1623 volume of Shakespeare&#x2019;s works in which many of his plays were printed for the first time. He was calm now&#x2014;all sense of dread and panic banished by the simple act of losing himself in an old book. Remembering how that First Folio, given the opportunity, always fell open to the third act of <i>Hamlet</i>, he spread the covers of the Malone and let the pages fall where they would. The book opened to page 289, revealing a piece of paper about four inches square. The brown foxing on the pages between which the paper had been pressed told Peter it had been there for at least a century. Out of habit more than curiosity he turned the paper over.</p><p>The sharp pain that stabbed his chest almost made him drop the book onto the dusty floor. He thought he had outrun that pain, that he could escape it with distance and distraction, but even in the corner of a bookshop in Hay-on-Wye it had found him. Knees suddenly weak, he slumped against a bookcase and watched, as if in a dream, as the paper fluttered to the floor. The face was still there; he closed his eyes, willing the face and all that went with it to retreat, willing his pulse to slow once more and his hands to stop shaking. He took a deep breath and opened his eyes. She lay there calmly, serenely, looking up at him, waiting. It was his wife. It was Amanda.</p><p>But Amanda was dead&#x2014;buried nine months ago in the red earth of North Carolina, an ocean away. A heartbeat away. And this painting, so much older than Amanda or her mother or her grandmother, could not possibly portray her. But it did.</p><p>Peter leaned over to retrieve the paper from the floor and examine it more closely. It was an expert watercolor, almost imperceptibly signed with the initials &#x201c;B.B.&#x201d; He looked again at the book from which it had fallen, hoping for a clue to the watercolor&#x2019;s origin. On the front endpaper was a penciled interlocking &#x201c;EH,&#x201d; the monogram of some long-forgotten owner. The description printed on a card inside the cover made no mention of a watercolor, only the price: �400. He had seen copies cataloged for half that. Copies that didn&#x2019;t hide a century-old painting of his dead wife.</p><p>On the shelf in front of him was a shabby copy of Dickens&#x2019;s unfinished final novel, <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>. The original cloth binding was worn at the corners and spine, the hinges were broken, and a few pages were loose, but nothing was missing. He could easily restore it to be worth two or three times the asking price.</p><p>Glancing around, he found himself still alone in the room. His hand trembling, Peter slipped the watercolor into <i>Edwin Drood</i>. He could not leave Amanda here, so far from home. He reshelved the Malone and tucked <i>Drood</i> under his arm. Twenty minutes later he had purchased a stack of books, including the Dickens, and was walking toward the car park on the outskirts of town, two heavy bags hanging at his sides.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>The drive from the Welsh border to Peter&#x2019;s cottage in the Oxfordshire village of Kingham took just over two hours. Peter&#x2019;s cottage was down a narrow lane from the village green and, like the rest of the village, built of golden Cotswold limestone. It was in the middle of a row of terraced cottages, but in five months of residence, Peter had yet to meet either of the neighbors with whom he shared the thick stone walls.</p><p>By seven, he had a fire in the grate, a cup of tea in his hand, and the watercolor propped up on the coffee table. Despite Dr. Strayer&#x2019;s advice, he had boxed all his pictures of Amanda and left them in the attic of the house in Ridgefield. So how could she be here, in what suddenly seemed like <i>her</i> cottage? She had, after all, picked out the William Morris fabric on the sofa and curtains. She had overseen the renovation of the kitchen and the addition of the conservatory. She had spent weekends in Portobello Road buying the Pilkington vases that stood on every windowsill and the Burne-Jones prints that hung in the upstairs hall. She had gone to country auctions to buy the furniture and had found the carpenter who installed the floor-to-ceiling bookshelves in the sitting room. The shelves had been her gift to Peter, the outward and visible sign of her passion for his passion; but everything else in the cottage was pure Amanda. She had never spent a night here, but that Peter could have lived here for five months and actually come to think of it as his cottage seemed silly now that she stood on the coffee table staring at him.</p><p>The painting showed a woman seated in front of a mirror, combing a long tress of dark hair. Her shoulders were bare, and her hair just covered her breasts. The dark hair and the pale skin were Amanda&#x2019;s as were the straight shoulders, and even the insistent way that she gripped the brush, but the most remarkable similarity was in the countenance that stared out from the mirror&#x2014;teasing and challenging at once. The resemblance was uncanny&#x2014;the narrow face, the high, pale forehead; and above all the deep green eyes that could laugh and demand to be taken seriously simultaneously. Amanda could do that. Of course the face couldn&#x2019;t be hers. She had been born in 1966; the watercolor was definitely Victorian. Still, Peter sat staring into Amanda&#x2019;s eyes, wondering where she had come from and wishing she had never left.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>He lost himself in those eyes, and in the past, for a few minutes, then roused himself, stood up, and began pacing the room. Here was a mystery that demanded a solution. During his years as an antiquarian bookseller, Peter had solved his share of bibliographical puzzles, but he had done so with the same emotional detachment with which he solved crosswords. This was different. The mystery of the watercolor&#x2019;s origins felt deeply personal and Peter could already feel curiosity and grief melding into obsession. He had to know where this painting came from&#x2014;how a hundred-year-old portrait of his wife, who had been born only twenty-nine years ago, had come to be tucked into an eighteenth-century book on Shakespeare forgeries.</p><p>The problem was how to begin. Peter had never worked with paintings before. It took him another hour of staring and pacing to remember what was in the bookcase in the spare room upstairs. He had not set foot in that room since he moved to Kingham. It had been intended as Amanda&#x2019;s sanctum sanctorum, and though she would never spend afternoons sitting there in the armchair reading her books, it still seemed an inviolable space. Now he opened the door slowly and looked into the stale silence. In the distance he heard the church bell toll nine and he waited until the last chime had died in the wet winter air before turning on the light.</p><p>In the bookcase by the window were sixty-five nearly identical volumes&#x2014;Peter&#x2019;s wedding gift to Amanda. Because it had been a Royal Academy exhibition catalog that brought them together, and because Amanda so loved her Victorian paintings, Peter had resolved to give her a copy of the catalog for every year of Victoria&#x2019;s reign&#x2014;an illustrated journey through seven decades of English art. It had taken him a year to track down all the volumes, but it had taken Amanda almost that long to plan the wedding. Now the books stood patiently on the shelves of the room she would never use.</p><p>Peter stood in the doorway for several minutes wrestling with the eerie sense of Amanda&#x2019;s presence. It wasn&#x2019;t just that this was Amanda&#x2019;s room furnished with her books and her favorite chair and the lamp she&#x2019;d picked out from the antique shop in Stow-on-the-Wold. Peter was used to living with Amanda&#x2019;s taste. This was different. This was a feeling that Amanda might return at any moment&#x2014;not the evanescent Amanda who sometimes spoke to him, but the real flesh-and-blood Amanda. It was a feeling Peter longed to embrace, but which he knew he must fight. He felt the same nausea and dizziness he had felt when they first met, and he had to lean against the doorway to steady himself.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; said Amanda. &#x201c;You can go in.&#x201d; She stood at the end of the hall and Peter looked up just in time to see her fade away. Her words gave him the courage he needed, though, and he entered the room, crossed to the bookshelf, pulled out the volume labeled &#x201c;1837,&#x201d; and sat gingerly on the edge of the chair. <i>These are just books; these are just things; this is just a room; and that was just my imagination, </i>he told himself. And although he didn&#x2019;t really believe it, he opened the book and began looking at paintings.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Before Peter had left for England, Dr. Strayer had given him a typed list of things he needed to do in order to move on with life. The second item was: &#x201c;Establish Regular Eating and Sleeping Habits.&#x201d; He had been making progress on this&#x2014;going to bed by eleven, sometimes falling asleep as early as one, and sleeping ...</p></p><h2>Disney Princess Beginnings: Jasmine&#39;s New Rules (Disney Princess) (A Stepping Stone Book(TM))</h2><p><b>An exciting chapter book series featuring all-new stories about each Disney Princess as a young girl!</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Disney Princess Jasmine is nine years old.

As emigrants, soldiers, tobacco lords, merchants, and colonial administrators, Scots were involved in nearly every aspect of running and financing Britain's colonies in America, Australia, and India. T. M. Devine, Scotland's leading historian, draws on a wealth of new material to provide a comprehensive examination of Scotland's multifaceted role in colonization. He deftly portrays the key contributions by Scots to the development of the Americas, from political ideas to business. In the first of a two-volume set, <i>Scotland's Empire</i> combines detailed scholarship with a compelling narrative history, setting the Scots' story against the rise of the British Empire, the course of American history, and the changes in world history. 35 b/w illustrations.</p></p><p><b>T.

He is a fellow of the British Academy and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Among his previous publications are the bestselling <i>The Scottish Nation, The Tobacco Lords, The Great Highland Famine</i>, and <i>Improvement and Enlightenment</i>. He lives in Aberdeen, Scotland.Eminent historian Devine follows up his acclaimed <i>The Scottish Nation, 1700&#x2013;2000</i> with a masterful study of the role of Scotland in the making of the British Empire and the development of colonial America, and empire's impact on Scotland. Drawing on extensive and never-before available archival materials, he chronicles the Scots' contributions to the empire with their business savvy, their philosophical traditions and their political strengths. The Scots, for example, were among the first to realize the tremendous value of tobacco as an import crop, so began to regulate its growth in the colonies and administer its sales in the empire. Devine documents the emigration and successful establishment of Scots throughout Europe, a pattern they continued as they began their assimilation into the British Empire. In the colonies, their experience as bankers, traders and administrators stood them in good stead as they developed centers of commerce in South Carolina and eventually in Nova Scotia, Canada. Devine also points out the debt that Jefferson, Franklin, Madison and other founders felt to Scottish commonsense philosophers such as Francis Hutcheson, David Hume and Thomas Reid, whose "common philosophy" stood behind the Declaration of Independence's "self-evident truths." Devine's magisterial study places the history of Scotland in global perspective, emphasizing in thoroughly captivating prose the Scots' contributions.

When Princeton physicist Gerard K. O'Neill published the first edition of <i>High Frontier</i> back in the mid 1970s (just four years after "Rocket Man," to be exact), he just assumed that some of us would be living in orbit by now. Or as the Space Studies Institute's George Friedman puts it in a new essay for this third edition of O'Neill's pioneering work, the L5 society's slogan "L5 in '95!" certainly wasn't referring to 2095.<p> In <i>High Frontier,</i> O'Neill had mapped out a straightforward, manifestly doable path to putting humans into space permanently and sustainably, using 1970s materiel and current-day Zubrin-style know-how. But O'Neill died in 1992 seeing humanity no closer to fulfilling his bold vision. Freeman Dyson points out in a new introduction to this edition that in many ways we've actually backslided, that the International Space Station (and the current role of NASA) is "not a step forward on the road to the High Frontier. It's a big step backward, a setback that will take decades to overcome."</p><p> But O'Neill's idea of pursuing an inexhaustible energy supply (solar power in space) and endless room to expand remains tantalizingly attractive. The science has only gotten easier, and the moral imperative has only become more pronounced, with the planet's resources ever steadily squeezed and the recent knowledge that a mass-extinction event on Earth is nearly inevitable. (O'Neill calls the High Frontier the only chance to make human life--perhaps all life in the universe--"unkillable.") The <i>High Frontier</i> is as exciting a read as it ever was, and six new chapters provide context for the advances made in the 25 years since O'Neill's original manifesto. But perhaps the best addition to this printing is the chance to see and hear the soft-spoken physicist himself, in more than an hour of MPEG video included on the CD-ROM. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p><b>Gerard K.

Reprint.</p><p>Because Christopher Pike is more commonly known for his young adult fiction, horror readers may not be familiar with this superb adult novel about an inhuman being that is menacing like a cobra to the souls as well as bodies of humans, and yet is also intensely curious. A quirky and resourceful handful of characters, including a 5000-year-old Hindu holy man, stumble over the various victims of the Cold One, and then gradually get to know each other, leading them all toward an unpredictable (if somewhat overcrowded) confrontation at a house on the beach in California. I agree with the <i>Washington Post's</i> assessment: "A polished, mature work with a grounding in Eastern philosophy. The characters are genuine, the action unexpected, violent, and wrenching. <i>The Cold One</i> is that rarest of horror novels, one that is visceral and intellectually stimulating at the same time."<br>Christopher Pike, the bestselling author of the Remember Me and The Last Vampire series, has more than fifty novels to his credit.

C. Beaton's beloved Agatha Raisin mystery series&#x2015;now a hit show on Acorn TV and public television.</p><p>Agatha Raisin is feeling miserable&#x2015;and with good reason. Her ex-husband, James, has abandoned her, and she's been humiliated by an unseemly proposition from John Armitage, her handsome neighbor. So complete is her devastation that Agatha has given up on makeup and taken to wearing the loose cotton dresses and flat, sensible shoes she has always abhorred.</p><p>But there is light at the end of this dark and lonely tunnel, and its source is Carsely's beatific new curate, Tristan Delon. With his golden hair, large blue eyes, and perfect mouth, Tristan has attracted the interest of more than a few of his female congregants. And to her surprise, he seems to have taken a special interest in Agatha.</p><p>Despite his charms, however, there is something odd about the curate, and after he's found dead in the vicar's study, it's up to Agatha and John to investigate.</p></p><p><p><b>Praise for M.

Though hardly faultless, Agatha remains the most feisty and fragile mystery heroine on the shelves."&#x2015;<i>St. Petersburg Times</i></p><p>"Agatha Raisin, a cranky, crude, and raunchy woman somehow (and this reviewer doesn't have a clue) manages to warm her way into the reader's heart and elicit their sympathy.

This one, however, adds a crackerjack plot and a delightfully comic ending to the mix, making it clearly the best of the lot."&#x2015;<i>Booklist </i>(starred review)</p><p>"M. C. Beaton's eleventh Agatha Raisin book is a reason to celebrate.... [It has all] the vitality and robustness of a new series."&#x2015;<i>Tulsa World</i></p>She's Disgruntled, Disheartened, Discontented...But Whoever Said Anything About Better Off Dead? <p>Wretched after being dumped by her husband, bored with pottering about Carsely, and wishing every man would sod off, including her neighbor John Armitage, Agatha Raisin is unmoved by news of the captivating new curate. But when she meets the golden-haired, blue-eyed Tristan Delon, she is swept off her feet...along with nearly every other female in the village. Wrapped in brightly coloured dreams of the curate (never mind that he's a tad odd), Agatha is as ecstatic as a girl when he invites her to dine.

The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, the sequel to Davis&#39;s Pulitzer Prize-winning The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture and the second volume of a proposed trilogy, is a truly monumental work of historical scholarship that first appeared in 1975 to critical acclaim both academic and literary. This reprint of that important work includes a new preface by the author, in which he situates the book&#39;s argument within the historiographic debates of the last two decades.</p><p><br><strong>David Brion Davis</strong> is Sterling Professor of History at Yale University. A former President of the Organization of American Historians, he has won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, the Bancroft Prize, and the American Historical Association's Beveridge Award. His most recent book is <em>The</em> <em>Boisterous Sea of Liberty: A Documentary History of America from Discovery through the Civil War</em> (Oxford University Press, 1998, with Steven Mintz).<br><br>"<em>The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution</em> by David Brion Davis is a work of majestic scale, written with great skill. It explores the growing consciousness, during a half century of revolutionary change, of the oldest and most extreme form of human exploitation. Concentrating on the Anglo-American experience, the historian also pursues his theme wherever it leads in western culture. His book is a distinguished example of historical scholarship and art."--From the citation for the 1975 National Book Award<p></p><br>"In...<em>The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture</em>, David Brion Davis displayed his mastery not only of a vast source of material, but also of the highly complex, frequently contradictory factors that influenced opinion on slavery. He has now followed this up with a study of equal quality....No one has written a book about the abolition of slavery that carries the conviction of Professor Davis's book. And this rich and powerful book will, I am sure, stand the test of time--scholarly, brilliant in analysis, beautifully written."--J. H. Plumb, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"As Davis's work demonstrates, good intellectual history is absolutely essential for an adequate understanding of the past; its proper subject is the way flesh-and-blood human beings make sense out of their world and try to gain some kind of mastery over it....It is obvious that Davis's interpretation was not imposed on his sources but resulted from a struggle to give them whatever structure and coherence seemed most consistent with the data itself and with the best recent historical work in the field. Nor does he attempt to explain <em>all</em> responses to the problem of slavery as ideological....Indeed the greatest strength of the book arises from its ability to provide a convincing general interpretation while doing full justice to a variety of historical experiences and perspectives....It is hard to imagine anyone going over the same ground for a long time."--George M. Fredrickson, <em>The New York Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"A worthy successor to Davis's magnificent <em>The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture</em>. Together, these volumes represent the high point of scholarship in this field. They will undoubtedly remain at the center of discussion for many decades and perhaps beyond."--Edward Genovese<p></p><br>"One of the many remarkable things about this book is that it equals and even exceeds the level of scholarship and history established by the author's preceding volume."--C. Vann Woodward<p></p><br>"A superb continuation of Davis's work on the problem of slavery in western culture. It is a fascinating and profound study of the rise of the antislavery movement in England and America, as well as of the social, political, and economic milieu in which it operated."--Stanley L. Engerman<p></p><br>"A penetrating work of mature scholarship and extraordinary erudition....It deals with a historical problem of vast and enduring moral importance."--Michael Kammen<p></p><br>"One of the most stunning books I have ever read....What is overpowering is the magnitude of the questions Davis asks and the seriousness with which he probes their complexities."--Sanford Levinson<p></p><br></p><h2>Unlocking The Sky: Glenn Hammond Curtiss and the Race to Invent the Airplane</h2><p><p>The first public flight in the United States. The first commercially sold airplane. The remarkable first flight from one American city to another. The first pilot license issued in this country. These were just a few of the milestones in the career of Glenn Hammond Curtiss, perhaps the greatest aviator and aeronautical inventor of all time.</p><p><em>Unlocking the Sky </em>tells his extraordinary story -- a tale of the race to design, refine, and manufacture a manned flying machine that took place in the air, on the ground, on the water, and in the courtrooms of America. Who would be the first to make a workable airplane, and almost as critical, who would control the right to use or sell this revolutionary technology?</p><p>While Orville and Wilbur Wright threw a veil of secrecy over their own flying machine at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1903, Curtiss teamed up with engineers in America and abroad, freely exchanging information in an attempt to resolve the most difficult challenges in constructing a reliable and stable airplane. In 1908, Curtiss piloted his groundbreaking <em>June Bug</em> in the first public flight in America. Fiercely jealous, the Wright brothers took to the courts to keep Curtiss and his airplanes out of the sky and off the market.</p><p><em>Unlocking the Sky </em>elevates Curtiss to his rightful place as an all-American hero. Ultimately, the Wright brothers were unsuccessful in their efforts to monopolize the airplane. With plot-twisting interventions from Alexander Graham Bell, Henry Ford, Samuel P. Langley, and, of course, Orville and Wilbur Wright, Seth Shulman's gripping narrative captures the dynamism of an era, a time much like our own, dominated by the struggle for control over fast-paced and unsettling technological change. It is a story of invention and adventure that shatters longheld myths about the birth of the airplane and raises profound questions about the way we remember history.</p></p><p>In the American imagination, Wilbur and Orville Wright are "earnest, young bicycle builders who attacked an age-old technological problem with fresh, ingenious thinking and dedication." There is plenty of truth to this, writes Seth Shulman, but it also obscures an important fact: The first flyers were so secretive and desperate to cash in on their invention that their behavior actually "retarded" the development of aviation. One of their most brutish acts involved a punishing legal fight with Glenn Hammond Curtiss, the inventor of the aileron (wing flaps that stabilize an aircraft in flight), retractable landing gear, pontoons, and much else. <i>Unlocking the Sky</i> suggests that Curtiss deserves at least near-equal billing with the brothers from Dayton. He performed the first public flight in the United States, sold the first commercial airplane, and piloted the first flight from one American city to another. "Curtiss surely belongs in the pantheon of America's greatest entrepreneurial inventors," writes Shulman. Yet he's virtually forgotten today, except by aficionados of aviation history. He comes across as a pioneering hero on these pages--and the Wright brothers as thuggish would-be monopolizers. This may be revisionist history, but it's a history that perhaps could stand revising. <i>--John J.

He lives in New York City.</p>Auster ( The Music of Chance ) captivatingly renews a theme central to his acclaimed New York Trilogy and Moon Palace --that of the other, the shadow self whose parallel life somehow jumps the track and threatens the more sober protagonist. After his valued friend and fellow writer Ben Sachs blows himself up with a bomb, Peter Aaron reviews their 15-year bond--including their shared love for Ben's lovely wife--and tries to reconstruct Ben's life. A boyhood experience in the Statue of Liberty haunted Ben until his transformation following a plunge from a fire escape at a drunken Fourth of July party in Brooklyn. After this fall, Ben stopped writing and became the "Phantom of Liberty," detonating Statue of Liberty replicas as a sign to America to "mend its ways." Peter's writing, on the other hand, surges "as though I had caught fire." The novel explores the fictional act: the relation between conflicting stories and kinds of truth; the reading of an address book, a la Sophie Calle, as a fertile text jammed with mysterious characters; role-reversal as self-discovery, practiced by photographer Maria and prostitute Lillian, women friends intimately linked to Peter and Ben. Finally, Peter (and Auster) appropriates the title of Ben's abandoned novel, a title that evokes the biblical sea monster and, thanks to Hobbes, the state, implying that the novel is itself a monster genre that merges diverse humans, their nightmares and passions. 25,000 first printing; author tour. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Veils of Time</h2><p>Today&#39;s bestselling romance writers invite you to four special weddings--across the veils of time...</p><p>Lynn Kurland is the USA Today bestselling author of Stardust of Yesterday, A Dance Through Time, This Is All I Ask, The Very Thought of You, Another Chance to Dream, The More I See You, and If I Had You.

Now, in his most colorful, personal, and important book to date, Mark Kurlansky turns his attention to a disappearing way of life: fishing&#x2013;how it has thrived in and defined one particular town for centuries, and what its imperiled future means for the rest of the world.<br><br>The culture of fishing is vanishing, and consequently, coastal societies are changing in unprecedented ways. The once thriving fishing communities of Rockport, Nantucket, Newport, Mystic, and many other coastal towns from Newfoundland to Florida and along the West Coast have been forced to abandon their roots and become tourist destinations instead. Gloucester, Massachusetts, however, is a rare survivor. The livelihood of America&#x2019;s oldest fishing port has always been rooted in the life and culture of commercial fishing.<br><br>The Gloucester story began in 1004 with the arrival of the Vikings. Six hundred years later, Captain John Smith championed the bountiful waters off the coast of Gloucester, convincing new settlers to come to the area and start a new way of life. Gloucester became the most productive fishery in New England, its people prospering from the seemingly endless supply of cod and halibut. With the introduction of a faster fishing boat&#x2013;the schooner&#x2013;the industry flourished. In the twentieth century, the arrival of Portuguese, Jews, and Sicilians turned the bustling center into a melting pot. Artists and writers such as Edward Hopper, Winslow Homer, and T. S. Eliot came to the fishing town and found inspiration.<br><br>But the vital life of Gloucester was being threatened. Ominous signs were seen with the development of engine-powered net-dragging vessels in the first decade of the twentieth century. As early as 1911, Gloucester fishermen warned of the dire consequences of this new technology. Since then, these vessels have become even larger and more efficient, and today the resulting overfishing, along with climate change and pollution, portends the extinction of the very species that fishermen depend on to survive, and of a way of life special not only to Gloucester but to coastal cities all over the world. And yet, according to Kurlansky, it doesn&#x2019;t have to be this way. Scientists, government regulators, and fishermen are trying to work out complex formulas to keep fishing alive. <br><br>Engagingly written and filled with rich history, delicious anecdotes, colorful characters, and local recipes, <b>The Last Fish Tale</b> is Kurlansky&#x2019;s most urgent story, a heartfelt tribute to what he calls &#x201c;socio-diversity&#x201d; and a lament that &#x201c;each culture, each way of life that vanishes, diminishes the richness of civilization.&#x201d;</p><p>Mark Kurlansky is the New York Times bestselling and James A.

A fish tale exaggerates to make things look bigger. It is triumphal. When in the early seventeenth century George Waymouth reported that the cod caught off New England were five feet long with a three-foot circumference, this may have been a fish tale. We don&#x2019;t know. Surely the Reverend Francis Higginson&#x2019;s reports from Salem in 1630 that lions had been seen running wild in Cape Ann, or that the squirrels could fly from tree to tree, were fish tales.<br><br>A Gloucester story is just the opposite. It is a story of miserable irony in which things are shown in their worst light, a story with a sad ending.<br><br>Often the history of a place begins with the person who named it. But in the case of Gloucester, the story begins with the men who didn&#x2019;t&#x2014; the ones who tried to name it and failed. The naming of Gloucester is an entire cycle of Gloucester stories.<br><br>The earliest Europeans to arrive at what is today Cape Ann are thought to have been the Vikings, who, according to the written Icelandic legends known as the Sagas, sailed in 1004 down the North American coast from Labrador to Newfoundland to a place they called Vineland. For a long time it was debated whether to believe this story. But in 1961 the remains of eight Viking turf houses dating to the year 1000 were found in a place in Newfoundland known as L&#x2019;Anse aux Meadows. Where, then, was Vineland? Today many historians believe that it was the coastline of New England, named after the wild grapes that grew there. According to another story, in 1004, Leif Ericson&#x2019;s brother Thorwald landed on Cape Ann and named it Cape of the Cross. But neither the name nor Thorwald went far. Thorwald died on the expedition and those historians who believe the story at all think that he is buried somewhere on Cape Ann. And that is the first Gloucester story.<br><br>In 1606, Samuel de Champlain, a French explorer of the coast of Maine, sailed down to Cape Ann, and seeing three islands off its tip&#x2014; now called Thachers, Milk, and Straitsmouth Islands&#x2014;he named the peninsula with the great gray granite boulders marking its headlands, the Cape of Three Islands, which even if said in French, Cap aux Trois �les, is not much of a name. He noted that there were actually two rocky headlands and a passage between them, which he sailed through taking depth soundings as he went, thus charting the course that fishermen home from the sea have been using ever since&#x2014;from Thachers around East Gloucester to Eastern Point, into the harbor between West and East Gloucester. Champlain thought this was an extraordinary harbor, deep and sheltered with ample mooring space, and he spent three months charting it. He named it Le Beau Port, which was a little more poetic than the Cape of Three Islands, but was destined to be no more durable. Being a skilled seaman, he found anchorage in the safest, most leeward cove in the harbor, but that was not to bear his name either. Instead, the sheltered nook is known today as Smith Cove, named after the young English adventurer, thirty- four-year-old Captain John Smith, who arrived eight years later, in 1614.<br><br>This Englishman was very different from Champlain. Though they both were prodigious writers, Champlain&#x2019;s writing revealed little about the man or his life. It is not even certain what year he was born. But Smith&#x2019;s writings are very much about himself, full of praise for his own extraordinary deeds. Historians, distrustful of Smith&#x2019;s braggadocio, tended not to believe what he wrote. Only in recent years has it come to be understood that most of his yarns of daredevil adventures are true.<br><br>Smith was a self-made man in more than one sense of that phrase. He not only made his own way in the world&#x2014;though always assisted by his remarkable ability to attract the patronage of the wealthy&#x2014;but he also used his writings to establish a colorful persona for himself.<br><br>When he was still a teenager he went off to the Lowlands, as did many adventurous young Englishmen, to help the Protestant Dutch fight for their freedom from the despotic Roman Catholics of Spain. The savage combat of that war produced many disillusioned young veterans for the new colonies. But Smith, after three years of fighting the Catholics, did not cross the Atlantic and instead joined the Austrian army to fight the Turks, the true infidels, in Hungary.<br><br>According to his immodest but generally accurate journals, Smith showed great cunning and courage and was rapidly promoted to the rank of captain, but then was captured by the Turks, who sent him into slavery in Turkey. There he found himself owned by an aristocratic woman whom he called &#x201c;the young Charatza Tragabigzanda.&#x201d; According to Smith, her name meant &#x201c;girl from Trebizond.&#x201d; Smith and his &#x201c;fair mistress,&#x201d; as he put it, developed some kind of friendship and it seemed a happy time until she gave him to her brother. The exact nature of Smith&#x2019;s relationship with his fair mistress is unclear, but throughout his life he would be rescued and befriended by young women of social standing. Many historians believe that Tragabigzanda had sent him to her brother to learn their language and customs&#x2014;she had communicated with Smith in Italian&#x2014;and that her plan was then to marry him. But Smith either did not understand or did not think much of this plan. He murdered her brother and escaped, traveling by horse to the Ukraine, then Poland, and on to Western Europe.<br><br>colonialism was the great opportunity for young English adventurers of the early seventeenth century. There were no traditions and few rules, and a resourceful young man could invent as he went along. Smith was personally involved in the two most important British colonies in North America, Virginia and Massachusetts. At the time, Virginia was seen as the more promising and it was the one that attracted sponsors and investors. But Smith believed that New England had better prospects for the future. The reason for this, he argued, was its wealth of fish. Smith maintained that New England fish were a natural resource worth more than gold. &#x201c;The sea is better than the richest mine known,&#x201d; he wrote.<br><br>This stance was surprising in an age of exploration dominated by highborn men who considered themselves above such activities as fishing and bringing fish to market. The traditional source of wealth for the great men of the Age of Exploration was gold.<br><br>It was his 1614 voyage that had convinced Smith of the importance of fishing. Having never been a man of affluence, one of the goals of his voyage was to somehow get rich. He had hoped to find gold but could find none. He then tried whaling, but did not encounter a suitable species. The only thing left was fishing, an activity he despised. So he ordered his men to go fishing, while he had himself and a crew lowered in a small boat to begin charting the coast, an activity he had developed a great fondness for in the Chesapeake. The little boat would move into every inlet and measure its nooks and turns, sounding depths so that their value for future ships would be documented.<br><br>Smith charted the coastline with great accuracy from the mouth of the Kennebec in Maine to Cape Cod and tried to name everything as he went. The British had simply referred to the area as part of Virginia, and it was Smith who gave it the name New England. But less successful were some of his other names. The island off Portsmouth, New Hampshire, that he dubbed Smyth&#x2019;s Iles&#x2014;his creative spelling, farfetched even for its day, would become infamous among latter historians&#x2014;is today the Isles of Shoals. His name for the granite- studded peninsula, today Cape Ann, was Tragabigzanda, and he called the three islands the Three Turks&#x2019; Heads in remembrance of three Turks whom he beheaded in duels six months before his capture.<br><br>Along the way, always looking for a little profit, he picked up fur pelts. He identified and sounded twenty-five &#x201c;excellent good harbors,&#x201d; but for reasons that are not clear he neglected to sound the harbor on the tip of Tragabigzanda, perhaps because Champlain had already done so. He did name the points along the tip of the coast including Halibut Point, which still bears the name, though while it is known as an excellent spot for catching striped bass and sometimes bluefish, there is no record of its ever being a place to land halibut.<br><br>Smith returned to Europe not only with his charts but also with seven thousand &#x201c;green cod,&#x201d; or salted fish, and forty thousand stockfish, or dried cod, that his men had landed off of Monhegan Island in southern Maine. England had recently opened trade with Europe and Smith was able to sell the fish in M�laga, where the price was high. M�laga also had a slave market, where he was able to sell twenty- seven locals whom he had lured onto his ship in New England.<br><br>The slave sale did not receive wide attention, but the reputed fortune he made on the fish became legendary. Some years later Massachusetts Governor William Bradford heard that it had been 60,000 fish, a fish tale. The fish, the map, the name New England&#x2014;all made a strong impression back in England. In fact, it was this story combined with Smith&#x2019;s map that convinced the exiled Pilgrims in Holland to start their colony in Smith&#x2019;s New England.<br><br>It was not a moment too soon, according to Smith. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, while explorers were searching for gold and spice routes, fortunes were being made on fishing, especially fishing cod. France and England were to fight repeated wars to secure control of North America&#x2019;s fish.<br><br>In an age without refrigeration, the fis...</p><h2>Doc: A Memoir</h2><p><p>A bruisingly honest memoir of addiction and recovery from one of the greatest pitchers of all time.</p> With fresh and sober eyes, Dwight Gooden shares the most intimate moments of his successes and failures, from endless self-destructive drug binges to three World Series rings.

It was their dream too.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;This is so much fun,&#x201d; our manager, Davey Johnson, told the people on the sidewalk and the many, many others watching on TV. &#x201c;I think we ought to try to do it again next year.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mookie Wilson, our switch-hitting center fielder, was thinking even bigger. &#x201c;Nineteen eighty-six,&#x201d; he thundered, &#x201c;the year of the Mets. Nineteen eighty-seven, year of the Mets. Nineteen eighty-eight, year of the Mets.&#x201d; Our victory was barely twelve hours old, and Mookie was already talking dynasty.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a glorious celebration. And right at the front of the crowd, a small boy was standing with a hand-lettered sign.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WE LOVE YOU, DOC, it said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too bad I couldn&#x2019;t thank him or even wave.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really wish I could have. But as everyone gathered in Lower Manhattan, I was twenty-five miles away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my teammates rode through the Canyon of Heroes, I was alone in my bed in Roslyn, Long Island, with the curtains closed and the TV on, missing what should have been the greatest morning of my life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#x2019;d spent all night in a sketchy housing project apartment near the Roosevelt Field mall, getting wasted with a bunch of people I hardly even knew. I was drinking shots of vodka. I was snorting lines of cocaine. And more lines of cocaine &#x2014; and more lines of cocaine. I didn&#x2019;t leave the drug party until after the sun came up. As my teammates toasted our triumph, I was nursing a head-splitting coke-and-booze hangover, too spent, too paranoid, and too mad at myself to drag my sorry butt to my own victory parade.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had never felt so lonely before.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I never feel that way again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#x2019;d have to look hard to find another young athlete in any sport who had risen so high so quickly and then fallen so hard. Too much, too fast, too young, my life was spinning wildly, and I was the one who didn&#x2019;t have a clue.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#x2019;d been the National League Rookie of the Year. I was the youngest player ever to appear in an All-Star Game, and when I stepped on the mound &#x2014; one, two, three &#x2014; I retired the side. Three days before my twenty-first birthday, I won the Cy Young Award as the league&#x2019;s best pitcher. That year, I also won the pitching Triple Crown, leading in wins, strikeouts, and earned runs. No pitcher had done that in thirteen years, and it would take another dozen before anyone did it again. For most of that breathless run, there was truly no stopping me. <i>Sports Illustrated</i> called me &#x201c;Dwight the Great.&#x201d; I was featured on the cover of <i>Time</i>. Nike hung a 105-foot mural of me on Manhattan&#x2019;s West Forty-Second Street. I was facing west, coming out of my windup, looking like I just might hurl that ball across the Hudson River to New Jersey and beyond.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heads up, LA!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And why not? With all that I&#x2019;d accomplished as the Mets&#x2019; young pitching ace, who could rule anything out?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New York&#x2019;s combative sportswriters could hardly agree on anything, but all of them seemed to agree on this: in a very short time at a very early age, I had become one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball, well on my way to greatest-ever territory. The Hall of Fame talk had already started. And now, to cap it all off, my team had just won the World Series in a come-from-behind seventh-game victory in front of the home crowd at Shea Stadium.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I had died that minute, I would have died a happy man. In hindsight, that might have saved a lot of people a lot of grief &#x2014; me at the top of the list.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was still only twenty-one.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Jesse Orosco threw his final game seven strikeout and the Red Sox were put away at last, I ran out of the bullpen, where I&#x2019;d been warming up for a late-game relief call, and out to the pitcher&#x2019;s mound, dry-diving onto a twisted pile of my teammates. In an instant, it seemed like the whole team was there. Hugging, slapping each other&#x2019;s backs, rolling around together in the infield dirt. Fans were bursting past police officers in riot gear, including some cops on horseback, and jumping onto our pile. As quickly as possible, team security hustled the players off the field and into the safety of the locker room.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The party revved up fast. Champagne corks were flying as the TV crews grabbed their postgame sound bites. The players were shouting each other&#x2019;s names. People started pouring champagne on other peoples&#x2019; heads. All of us agreed how great we were.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the early craziness of the locker room, two thoughts were crowding all the others out of my head: <i>I gotta call my dealer. And I gotta call my dad</i>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father was watching at home with my mom in Tampa. I called him from the clubhouse phone, getting it out of the way as soon as I&#x2019;d had my second gulp of champagne. I always called my dad after a game. He deserved this victory as much as I did. &#x201c;Yeah, it feels great, Dad &#x2014; thanks,&#x201d; I told him before hanging up the phone. &#x201c;I love you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I traded a few more handshakes and hugs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By then, the beer and the hard booze were coming out &#x2014; the vodka and the R�my Martin. That stuff was always kept out of view of the reporters, tucked away in the back of the players&#x2019; lockers or in the equipment room. But it magically appeared that night. After what we&#x2019;d just accomplished, who was going to complain? I had a couple of rounds, Absolut and grapefruit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I grabbed my chance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&#x2019;t think anyone would notice in the excitement of the moment, and no one did. I slipped into the trainer&#x2019;s office, where I knew I could make my other call without being disturbed. I had the number memorized. I tried to appear casual, like maybe I was ordering a pizza.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Hey, I&#x2019;ll be coming by later tonight,&#x201d; I said to my dealer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Congratulations, man!&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Yeah, thanks,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Just make sure you&#x2019;re available, okay? It&#x2019;s gonna be a big party.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I got whatever you need,&#x201d; he told me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drinks were still flowing. People were still hugging and calling each other&#x2019;s names. Guys who&#x2019;d had little squabbles during the season were making up, shaking champagne bottles and spraying each other. I bumped into Bob Ojeda, who was shouting, &#x201c;I love you, man!&#x201d; I told Ron Darling how awesome he&#x2019;d pitched in the series. Lenny Dykstra, as bouncy and wide-eyed as ever, looked as though he could hardly believe he was there &#x2014; or that he&#x2019;d whacked that clutch game three home run.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;The parade&#x2019;s gonna be awesome,&#x201d; Lenny said to me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Awesome,&#x201d; I agreed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had to get up early the next morning. I knew that. We were due at the stadium in Queens between eight and nine. Then we&#x2019;d all pile onto buses and ride into Manhattan for the start of the parade. But no one looked ready to call it a night. I certainly wasn&#x2019;t. Word went around that the party was moving to Finn MacCool&#x2019;s, a bar on Main Street in Port Washington, close to where many of the players lived.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was already too drunk to be driving. I&#x2019;d had three or four glasses of champagne and at least as many vodka-and-grapefruits. But I didn&#x2019;t give drunk driving a second thought. Back then, I never did. I walked out to the players&#x2019; parking lot and climbed into my car, a gray 1986 Mercedes 300SE. I turned on the ignition and, bleary but still fairly steady, I headed in the general direction of the bar.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I never got there.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, I jumped off the Long Island Expressway at the Meadowbrook Parkway and headed south, straight for the projects.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My whole plan was to meet my dealer, buy some coke, and do a little bit &#x2014; then depending on how I was feeling and how late it was, maybe circle back to Finn MacCool&#x2019;s and have a few last rounds with the boys.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my way to the dealer&#x2019;s apartment, I stopped and picked up my friend Bobby, who lived in the same projects. Bobby wasn&#x2019;t a close friend, just someone I&#x2019;d partied with in Tampa who lived part-time in New York. He had introduced me to the dealer a few months earlier. When I first started buying, I would give the money to Bobby, and he&#x2019;d make the transaction for me. But as I&#x2019;d grown bolder, I was usually buying for myself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stopped at the dealer&#x2019;s apartment. I gave him the money for the drugs. Then Bobby and I headed back to his place to get high. The dealer followed us there.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bobby&#x2019;s apartment was on the second floor. It was tiny, and people were already there. Bobby&#x2019;s sister was one of them, and there were others I didn&#x2019;t recognize, five or six women and seven or eight men. The music was loud &#x2014; Run-DMC, Whodini, Public Enemy, old-school hip-hop. The TV was on, playing game highlights with the sound off. It was the last week in October. Even though the windows were open, it was hot and stuffy in there.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone congratulated me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, man,&#x201d; one guy said, hugging me so hard I could feel the heavy gold chain around his neck.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, man,&#x201d; I said back to him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a world champion,&#x201d; said a woman in a shiny gold top.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right away, the drugs came out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I laid two lines on a mirror Bobby handed me. I slid a rolled-up dollar bill into my nose and sniffed hard. Ah, that felt good.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did it again on the other side.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nice, warm feeling was already sweeping through me. This, I thought, is what I had been waiting for.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I remember checking the clock, it said twelve thirty. Then, what seemed like twenty minutes later, it said a little after two o&#x2019;clock.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could hear fans partying in other apartments. People were yelling outside and lighting off fireworks. If they&#x2019;d only known where one of the Mets was! It was crazy, even being there. Somewhere in my mind, I must have realized that. There was no security. At any moment, the cops could have burst in, and I would have been busted. Or someone could have robbed me. My $50,000 Mercedes was sitting outside.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I didn&#x2019;t care. This was where the coke was, so this was where I wanted to be.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#x2019;s pretty much how the evening went.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do a shot.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do a line.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk nonsense.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the clock.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice how late it was.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the coke.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do another line.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forget about the clock.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear how great I am.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do a shot.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch some highlights.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bullshit with strangers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the clock.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do another line.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that clock was moving like you wouldn&#x2019;t believe. I knew I had to get up early, but I had a plan.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna stay here till four o&#x2019;clock,&#x201d; I said to myself. &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll give me time to go home, get an hour or two of sleep, grab a shower, and be at Shea in time.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing I noticed, the clock said four thirty. &#x201c;A couple of more lines, and I&#x2019;m out of here at five,&#x201d; I told myself. &#x201c;No matter what.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the drugs kept coming. The shots too. People kept laughing. I was having too much fun to leave.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A girl came over and climbed onto my lap. She was pushing her breasts against me and wiggling around. We were doing everything but having sex. I&#x2019;m sure if I wanted to, I could have taken her into the bedroom. But sex wasn&#x2019;t my top priority at that moment. I was far more interested in the drugs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;ll stay another thirty minutes,&#x201d; I thought, still managing to bargain the worry away. &#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ll get out of here.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked out the window at one point and felt my first wave of fear.

In Killing Sacred Cows, Garrett B. Gunderson exposes ingrained fallacies and misguided traditions in the world of personal finance. He presents a revolutionary perspective that can create opportunity and wealth for thoughtful, mission-driven individuals. Our financial lives are connected to our societal contributions, and we must be financially free in order to achieve our fullest potential. Sadly, most people are held captive in their financial lives by misinformation, propaganda, and limited knowledge. Through well-reasoned arguments, unflinching logic, and revelatory insight, Gunderson defeats common clich�s and faulty retirement planning advice to plainly demonstrate the following and much more: 401(k)s and the stock market are the most risky investments for most people and the gambling mindset they induce creates disastrous consequences. Conventional retirement planning advice, products, strategies, and techniques expose you to significant danger of being unable to retire, or of running out of money prematurely if you do. Building net worth is a recipe for creating a life of fear and poverty and how to escape that common trap. Debt may not be what you think it is and why that matters to your prosperity. &#39;High risk equals high returns&#39; is destructive dogma and how reducing risk can increase your returns. Killing Sacred Cows is a must-read for brave individuals willing to question common assumptions and teachings, overcome the herd mentality, break through financial myths, and live a purposeful, passionate, and prosperous life.</p><p></p><h2>Book of Revelation: Unlocking the Future (21st Century Biblical Commentary Series) (Volume 16)</h2><p><p><b>WILL THE HUMAN RACE SURVIVE IN THE FUTURE?<br></b></p><p><b>EVERYONE IS CURIOUS ABOUT THE FUTURE.</b> There is something in human nature that wants to know what is going to happen next.

It's God's road map to help us understand&nbsp; where human history is going. In the biblical record, human history begins in a garden and ends in the eternal city.

In between, there stands a cross! and on that cross, Jesus Christ changed the course of human history forever.</p><p>The message of the Bible represents the timeless truth of God. As each generation seeks to apply that truth to its specific context it becomes necessary for an up-to-date commentary to be created just for them.

They were hired not only for their skills but also to demonstrate the social standing of their employers&#x2015;even as they were required to tread softly and blend into the background. More than simply the laboring class serving the upper crust&#x2015;as popular culture would have us believe&#x2015;they were a diverse group that shaped and witnessed major changes in the modern home, family, and social order. <p>Spanning over a hundred years, Lucy Lethbridge?in this "best type of history" (<em>Literary Review</em>)?brings to life through letters and diaries the voices of countless men and women who have been largely ignored by the historical record. She also interviews former and current servants for their recollections of this waning profession.</p><p>At the fore are the experiences of young girls who slept in damp corners of basements, kitchen maids who were required to stir eggs until the yolks were perfectly centered, and cleaners who had to scrub floors on their hands and knees despite the wide availability of vacuum cleaners.

As the Imperial Japanese Army swept across China and South Asia at the war's outset--closing all of China's seaports--more than 200,000 Chinese laborers embarked on a seemingly impossible task: to cut a seven-hundred-mile overland route--which would be called the Burma Road--from the southwest Chinese city of Kunming to Lashio, Burma. But with the fall of Burma in early 1942, the Burma Road was severed, and it became the task of the newly arrived American General Stilwell to re-open it, while, at the same time, keeping China supplied by air-lift from India and simultaneously driving the Japanese out of Burma as the first step of the Allied offensive toward Japan.<br>In gripping prose, Donovan Webster follows the breathtaking adventures of the American "Hump" pilots who flew hair-raising missions over the Himalayas to make food-drops in China; tells the true story of the mission that inspired the famous film <i>The Bridge on the River Kwai</i>; and recounts the grueling jungle operations of Merrill's Marauders and the British Chindit Brigades. Interspersed with vivid portraits of the American General "Vinegar Joe" Stilwell, the exceedingly eccentric British General Orde Wingate, and the mercurial Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek, <i>The Burma Road</i> vividly re-creates the sprawling, sometimes hilarious, often harrowing, and still largely unknown stories of one of the greatest chapters of World War II.<br></p><p><b>Donovan Webster </b>was a senior editor for <i>Outside </i>and now writes for <i>National Geographic</i>, <i>Smithsonian</i>, and <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>.

They say the route itself exists only as a memory, that the road's two stringy lanes-now more than sixty years old-certainly have been devoured by landslides and rain and swampy jungle vegetation.<br><br>But now, step after step-and in the cool of a mid-January morning-my feet are moving up the same gravel pike the Old Soldiers have cautioned me about. I'm walking between walls of jungle that rise from the roadside like green tapestries a hundred feet tall; setting off for the places where the Old Soldiers' friends died, their own sweat fell, and-perhaps more than anything-where the nightmares that still find them were seared into place so firmly that, when they're jolted awake in their beds at night, they can still taste the acrid gunpowder smoke and feel the jungle's leeches beneath their damp cotton uniforms.<br><br>In the morning light, the pavement ahead crooks hard right, twisting back on itself and disappearing over the brow of the next forested hill. Here, near the road's beginning, just a few miles northeast of the crowded Indian ghetto of Ledo, the road's original gravel and asphalt is pitted and broken. Its shoulders disintegrate at the forest's edges, and in some places potholes stretch across the pavement's width, leaving it striped with breaks.<br><br>Still-contrary to what the Old Soldiers believe-the road exists. Thirty feet wide and snaking ahead beneath mature trees dripping with vines, it bends uphill toward green-draped mountains. It slides past barracks for Indian army border patrols and the jungle huts of tribal natives, its course run by motorbikes, buses full of coalfield workers, and trucks hauling illegal harvests of teakwood, despite such cutting having been outlawed years ago. This place is so far at the world's edge, it seems, nobody cares what goes on here.<br>FRIDAY MORNING, ten o'clock. Above me, inside a cloudless sky, the sun is clearing the treetops, its yellow footfall dapples the roadbed. The air is moist and sixty-five degrees. Jungle mists spill from the forest, their faint fog softening the sunlight around me. Through the surrounding trees, gray parakeets dart among branches. An oxcart creaks past, carrying sections of a teak trunk lashed to its bed. One of India's sacred bulls wanders the road just ahead: it's white furred-with one of its horns painted glossy green, the other yellow-and it seems supremely unconcerned by the vehicles that swerve to avoid it.<br><br>I stretch my back, having spent last night on a plywood bed in the Hotel Raj, a toilet-and-cold-shower-down-the-hall cell off a cobblestone bazaar in Ledo's crowded downtown. All night the locals came out to stare at the hotel's second-floor balcony from the plaza below, shouting greetings to me, the visitor.<br><br>"Hello, American!" they'd yell. Then they'd stand on the cobblestones and gaze upward, expecting me to step onto the narrow balcony and wave. Across the alley, in a small and dingy restaurant, a fire flickered in the mud oven, heating curries and illuminating the restaurant's soot-blackened walls. A handful of kids shouted to me as they played netless badminton in the alley. For a half-hour, my only response to the welcome squad below curled from the air vents of my room, as smoke from burning mosquito coils drifted into the night sky.<br><br>Finally, realizing I couldn't ignore them and expect much peace, I went downstairs and played badminton with a twelve-year-old girl named Djela. She was four feet tall and skinny, her shiny black hair cropped at her jaw. She had dark skin and deep black eyes, and she was all smiles and "Where you come from?"<br><br>Djela and her family were also new to town, she said. Six months earlier, they'd moved into a room up the street from Bangladesh. Djela's father, she said, had relocated to Ledo to be a laborer in the town's coal mine. Then she handed me one of the two broken-stringed badminton racquets she was carrying, and we began to smack a little plastic shuttlecock up and down the alley over an imaginary net.<br><br>After a few minutes, I thanked Djela for the game. Then I walked through the spice shop that was the Hotel Raj's ground floor-watched like a zoo animal the whole time-and returned to my second-floor room.<br><br>"Hello, American" continued to ring in the alley for hours after I'd slid tight the bolt on my door, climbed beneath my mosquito net, and blown out the candle that was my room's only light.<br>NOW, IN THE MORNING, I stare up the road, then lift my pack to continue on. Wooden telephone and electric poles from World War II-glass insulators still in place-hopscotch the pavement, their webs of wires long gone. Back in late 1942, when this road was first being laid by American engineer battalions, no Allied commander or soldier would have believed that, over the coming twenty-seven months, as they chiseled this track over mountains and slapped it across swamps at a mile per day, the Japanese would devil them for most every foot. Before the road was complete, Japanese snipers and artillery shells (and disease and accidents) would kill more than one American soldier for each of the road's eleven hundred miles.<br><br>Back at the road's beginnings in 1942 and '43, they also wouldn't have believed that for every Allied combat casualty in the war's China-Burma-India theater of operations, fourteen more soldiers would be evacuated sick or dead from malaria, dysentery, cholera, infections, jungle rot, and a previously unknown infection called brush typhus. They wouldn't have believed that, before the road's journey was over, the theater's beloved but irascible commander-the American General "Vinegar Joe" Stilwell-would be removed; that their eccentric and death-defying special-forces leader-Lt. General Orde Wingate of the British army-would be killed in a shocking accident; and that, perhaps worst of all, the road they fought for and died to build would be deemed obsolete even as it was being finished. Before he was done there, Stilwell could do little more than lean on the scrap of dog-Latin he'd made famous as his motto: Illegitimati non Carborundum. He translated it as "Don't let the bastards grind you down."<br></p><h2>Where I Live Now: Stories 1993-1998</h2><p>Set mainly in Los Angeles, Lucia Berlin&#39;s gritty working-class stories bridge the gap between the Americas - rich and poor, North and South, Anglo and Hispanic. While her style has been compared to Raymond Carver&#39;s, and her dream- and drink-addicted characters to Richard Yates&#39;, her fictional territory and fatalistic humor are hers alone.</p><p>The 18 affecting stories in this compelling collection, Berlin's third in a decade (after Homesick and So Long), are set predominantly in the Southwest, and often feature hapless women addicted to alcohol or married to drug addicts. In "Mijito," 17-year-old pregnant Amelia Romero, homesick for Mexico and speaking no English, sees her no-good husband, Manolo, disappear behind prison bars moments after their marriage. In "Carmen," pregnant Mona is sent on an ill-fated drug run by her addicted husband. Carlotta Moran, the incorrigible heroine of "Let Me See You Smile," can't stay sober long enough to get her life in gear. Other stories feature children as victims: Lu, the older, less-loved sister of the linked stories "Mama," "Silence" and "Sometimes in Summer," dodges the lurid advances of a drunken grandfather and tries to protect her young sister, Sally, from his grasp. The theme of devoted siblings resurfaces as Do a Claudia cares tenderly for her dying sister in "Del Gozo Al Pozo." Happily, Berlin exhibits a flair for comedy, which surfaces in a few tales, lightening the mood. "Evening in Paradise" pits a harried hotel-keeper against hopped-up Hollywood celebrities and small-town hustlers as the imagined cast and crew of The Night of the Iguana shake up Puerto Vallarta, while in the caustically witty "The Wives," Laura and Decca hilariously dissect their mutual ex-husband. There are minor flaws--Berlin's occasional use of two narrators tends to confuse, and some readers may be put off by her reluctance to translate Spanish--but for the most part, she is marvelously successful, placing her memorable characters in gripping situations, plumbing their messed-up lives for pathos and allowing us to see deeply into their souls.

The author of <i>Somebody Else: Arthur Rimbaud in Africa</i> and <i>The Reckoning: The Murder of Christopher Marlowe</i>, among other books. Nicholl�&#x2019;s articles have appeared in <i>Granta, Rolling Stone</i>, and the <i>London Review of Books</i>.Nicholl aims for the man behind the myth in this penetrating, highly detailed biography, which recognizes da Vinci's "mysterious greatness as an artist, scientist and philosopher" but avoids hagiography (and nearly steers clear of the word "genius"). The illegitimate child of a Tuscan peasant girl and a local notary, da Vinci (1452&#x2013;1519) was apprenticed as a teen to Florence sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio. Nicholl (<i>Somebody Else: Arthur Rimbaud in Africa</i>) conjectures convincingly about Leonardo's early career, though he tends to dwell overlong on technical aspects of Renaissance art production. Leonardo established a Florentine studio in 1477, but it was not until he moved to Milan five years later that he began to produce his iconic works: the painting <i>Virgin of the Rocks</i>, the famous Vitruvian Man drawing. Nicholl chronicles the production of <i>The Last Supper</i> and makes a firm statement about the <i>Mona Lisa</i>'s identity. Numerous questions about Leonardo's life remain, unavoidably, unanswered, but Nicholl fills in the gaps with insight into the artist's cultural milieu, offering tidbits about Leonardo's sexuality, the sordid goings-on at the Borgia court and the multifarious fruits of the artist's astonishingly fertile curiosity and imagination. Nicholl's attention to da Vinci's polymathic pursuits, as well as his own translations from the artist's numerous notebooks, are some of this dense but readable volume's most compelling aspects.

Dr. Wilmer explores the Jungian approach in a deceptively light style, bringing not only his years of experience but his special wit, wisdom, and skill as an illustrator. <p>Anyone interested in the process of psychotherapy&#x2014;from beginning students to experienced practitioners, and even those in therapy, will gain a fresh understanding and new insights, while enjoying many a few chuckles along the way.</p></p><p><b>Harry Aron Wilmer,</b> M.D. (1917-2005), was founder, emeritus director, and president of the Institute for the Humanities at Salado, the small central Texas village where he had lived since 1971, and where he was a senior Jungian analyst in private practice. Wilmer received his M.D. and other degrees from the University of Minnesota. He has been a National Research Council fellow in the medical sciences at Johns Hopkins, a fellow in internal medicine and neuropsychiatry at the Mayo Clinic, where he was also a consultant in psychiatry. Dr. Wilmer's creative work in the Navy was the subject of an award-winning ABC docudrama, starring Lee Marvin, with Arthur Kennedy as Wilmer. Bill Moyers produced two PBS television documentaries on Wilmer&#x2019;s work at the Salado institute. Dr. Wilmer authored numerous books and articles and lectured throughout the world. He and his wife Jane raised five children. He died in his home at the age of eighty-eight.I am deeply impressed by Wilmer's enormous creativity.... It is certainly impressive, on the one hand, how he manages to 'make Jung easy' and, on the other, how genuinely Jungian he is with his patients. I should like to declare that if there is a genuine Jungian in the U.S., it is a certain Harry Wilmer. &#x2014;<b>C. A.

He and his mentor Donner later co-wrote <i>Superman: Last Son </i>featuring the return of General Zod.<br> <br> Johns has written for various other media, including episodes of <i>Smallville, Arrow</i> and <i>Adult Swim&#x2019;s Robot Chicken</i>, for which he was nominated along with his co-writers for an Emmy. He is the Chief Creative Officer of DC Entertainment and resides in Los Angeles, California.The danger for superhero collections&#x2014;for any serialized storytelling, really&#x2014;is the risk of alienating new readers with complex backstories and plotlines. This volume, serving as both an origin tale for longtime archenemy Professor Zoom and as a precursor to DC&#x2019;s line-shattering Flashpoint event, runs that risk more than most. If you&#x2019;re entering in the middle and leaving in the middle, why should you engage and invest? Johns counters this concern with a story that, though heavily entangled in continuity, compellingly focuses on the emotional journey of the Flash as he tries to reconcile with his past and his family while investigating a case of murder by premature aging and the arrival of a doppelg�nger from a parallel time line. Meanwhile, Kolins&#x2019; always-solid art basks in standout color work that paints the action in crackling reds and yellows and the human end of the story in soft greens, browns, and beiges for an extra layer of emotional texture.

Richardson sorts through conflicting testimonies about the notorious poet of Les Fleurs du mal: He was a voluptuary, he was a virgin; he indulged in drink, he drank moderately. In fact, according to the author, he was a man divided against himself, unable to resist carnal desires yet feeling degraded by them--a true Catholic at heart, despite his conviction in 1857 for offending public morality with his poems. But Richardson primarily hangs her view of Baudelaire on one thread: the unhealthy symbiosis between the poet and his mother, and the poet's conflicting needs, first, to avenge himself on her for remarrying and abandoning him emotionally when he was a boy; and, second, to recover the earlier, idyllic period of her widowhood, when he was the focus of her love. Quoting liberally from the poet's letters to his mother, Richardson limns a life as wearying to the reader as it must have been to the poet: the endless cajoling and castigating requests for money (youthful extravagance by the poet-dandy had led to the appointment of a trustee to dole out his inheritance), efforts to flee creditors, writings conceived but never executed. His devotion to the prostitute Jeanne Duval was thus a revenge against his conventional mother; his chaste love for the courtesan Apollonie Sabatier was an attempt to recover the lost maternal love. This is all credible but not very satisfying, for as Richardson herself shows, this man was highly complex: rebellious, sensitive, egotistical, self-doubting, cynical, naive. Yet while highlighting Baudelaire's misery, she fails to illuminate the means by which he, as he once put it, turned the mud of life into poetic gold. Fortunately she does rely heavily on quoting letters from the time, and thus presents a heartrending picture of Baudelaire's last year, before his death at the age of 46 in 1867: Struck by hemiplegia and aphasia, the poet who had made such exquisite use of language was virtually unable to utter a word. Strictly for students and devotees of this great po&#x160;te maudit. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Baudelaire's discarding of the conventional distinctions between good and evil and his assertion of the beauty and truth found in the perverse and grotesque would pit him against the censors of his day. Upon the publication of <i>Les Fleurs du Mal</i> (<i>Flowers of Evil</i>) in 1857, he was prosecuted on morals and obscenity charges and narrowly escaped imprisonment. In this extraordinary biography, Richardson (the author of highly regarded lives of Stendhal, Verlaine, and Hugo) finds that the leading French "decadent," initially at least, invented himself, that his early use of hashish, his talk and writing of sexual perversity and depravity, his morbidity and dissolution, were part of "his attempt to create his legend." While "the satanism of Baudelaire was only a pose," she writes, "the anguish . . . was real and absolute." And much of that anguish grew out of his tormented, inordinate love for his mother, a woman who practically abandoned her sensitive son, packing him off to boarding schools so that he would not irritate his new stepfather. Baudelaire did become addicted to drugs and alcohol later in life, though probably for medicinal reasons, as he struggled to quell the agonies of several ailments, including syphilis. Baudelaire had "a taste for squalid sexual encounters," but Richardson agrees with most biographers that his only "passionate love" was for Jeanne Duval, a drunken, addicted, black lesbian with no qualms about exploiting the writer's weaknesses. This is a massive, remarkable work, revelatory about all the stages of Baudelaire's fascinating life: in every way, a literary biography. <i>Ron Antonucci</i></p><h2>The Assault on Truth: Freud&#39;s Suppression of the Seduction Theory</h2><p>An expose of the origins of psychoanalysis argues that Freud&#39;s abandonment of the seduction theory was not the result of scientific research</p><p>&#x201c;A Watergate of the psyche.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>The New York Times Book Review<br></i><br>With a new introduction by the author<br><b>&#x201c;A LAVISHLY DOCUMENTED, CAREFULLY REASONED WORK, WRITTEN IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD, REASONABLE STYLE.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>The Nation</i></b><br><b>&#x201c;INTRIGUING AND THOUGHT-PROVOKING . . .

And why has the psychoanalytic community gone to such lengths to conceal that retraction?

But before you look at the little handcrafted treasures I have for sale, let&#x2019;s talk about them for a bit, shall we? It won&#x2019;t take long. Here, sit down beside me. And do come a little closer. I don&#x2019;t bite.<br> <br>Except&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we&#x2019;ve known each other for a very long time, and I suspect you know that&#x2019;s not entirely true.<br> <br>Is it?<br> I<p></p> <br>You&#x2019;d be surprised&#x2014;at least, I think you would be&#x2014;at how many people ask me why I still write short stories. The reason is pretty simple: writing them makes me happy, because I was built to entertain. I can&#x2019;t play the guitar very well, and I can&#x2019;t tap-dance at all, but I can do this. So I do.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m a novelist by nature, I will grant you that, and I have a particular liking for the long ones that create an immersive experience for writer and reader, where the fiction has a chance to become a world that&#x2019;s almost real. When a long book succeeds, the writer and reader are not just having an affair; they are married. When I get a letter from a reader who says he or she was sorry when The Stand or 11/22/63 came to an end, I feel that book has been a success.<br> <br>But there&#x2019;s something to be said for a shorter, more intense experience. It can be invigorating, sometimes even shocking, like a waltz with a stranger you will never see again, or a kiss in the dark, or a beautiful curio for sale laid out on a cheap blanket at a street bazaar. And, yes, when my stories are collected, I always feel like a street vendor, one who sells only at midnight. I spread my assortment out, inviting the reader&#x2014;that&#x2019;s you&#x2014;to come and take your pick. But I always add the proper caveat: be careful, my dear, because some of these items are dangerous. They are the ones with bad dreams hidden inside, the ones you can&#x2019;t stop thinking about when sleep is slow to come and you wonder why the closet door is open, when you know perfectly well that you shut it.<br> II<p></p> <br>If I said I always enjoyed the strict discipline shorter works of fiction impose, I&#x2019;d be lying. Short stories require a kind of acrobatic skill that takes a lot of tiresome practice. Easy reading is the product of hard writing, some teachers say, and it&#x2019;s true. Miscues that can be overlooked in a novel become glaringly obvious in a short story. Strict discipline is necessary. The writer has to rein in his impulse to follow certain entrancing side paths and stick to the main route.<br> <br>I never feel the limitations of my talent so keenly as I do when writing short fiction. I have struggled with feelings of inadequacy, a soul-deep fear that I will be unable to bridge the gap between a great idea and the realization of that idea&#x2019;s potential. What that comes down to, in plain English, is that the finished product never seems quite as good as the splendid idea that rose from the subconscious one day, along with the excited thought, Ah man! I gotta write this right away!<br> <br>Sometimes the result is pretty good, though. And every once in awhile, the result is even better than the original concept. I love it when that happens. The real challenge is getting into the damned thing, and I believe that&#x2019;s why so many would-be writers with great ideas never actually pick up the pen or start tapping away at the keys. All too often, it&#x2019;s like trying to start a car on a cold day. At first the motor doesn&#x2019;t even crank, it only groans. But if you keep at it (and if the battery doesn&#x2019;t die), the engine starts&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. runs rough&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and then smooths out.<br> <br>There are stories here that came in a flash of inspiration (&#x201c;Summer Thunder&#x201d; was one of those), and had to be written at once, even if it meant interrupting work on a novel. There are others, like &#x201c;Mile 81,&#x201d; that have waited their turn patiently for decades. Yet the strict focus needed to create a good short story is always the same. Writing novels is a little like playing baseball, where the game goes on for as long as it needs to, even if that means twenty innings. Writing short stories is more like playing basketball or football: you&#x2019;re competing against the clock as well as the other team.<br> <br>When it comes to writing fiction, long or short, the learning curve never ends. I may be a Professional Writer to the IRS when I file my tax return, but in creative terms, I&#x2019;m still an amateur, still learning my craft. We all are. Every day spent writing is a learning experience, and a battle to do something new. Phoning it in is not allowed. One cannot increase one&#x2019;s talent&#x2014;that comes with the package&#x2014;but it is possible to keep talent from shrinking. At least, I like to think so.<br> <br>And hey! I still love it.<br> III<p></p> <br>So here are the goods, my dear Constant Reader. Tonight I&#x2019;m selling a bit of everything&#x2014;a monster that looks like a car (shades of Christine), a man who can kill you by writing your obituary, an e-reader that accesses parallel worlds, and that all-time favorite, the end of the human race. I like to sell this stuff when the rest of the vendors have long since gone home, when the streets are deserted and a cold rind of moon floats over the canyons of the city. That&#x2019;s when I like to spread my blanket and lay out my goods.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s enough talk. Perhaps you&#x2019;d like to buy something, now, yes? Everything you see is handcrafted, and while I love each and every item, I&#x2019;m happy to sell them, because I made them especially for you. Feel free to examine them, but please be careful.<br> <br>The best of them have teeth.<br> <br>August 6, 2014</p><h2>Princesses Behaving Badly: Real Stories From History Without the Fairy-Tale Endings</h2><p>This book contains real stories from History - Without the Fairy-Tale Endings !</p><p></p><h2>My Life in the Service: The World War II Diary of George McGovern</h2><p><p>Before he was a celebrated politician, Senator George McGovern served as a B-24 bomber pilot in World War II.

As Andrew Bacevich states in his introduction, &#x201c;We also come to understand why McGovern, having experienced combat at first hand, was not in later life among those given to glorifying war or to sending their fellow citizens to fight when not absolutely necessary.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We are all heaving a sigh of relief that it is in the past,&#x201d; McGovern wrote near the end of his training, which took him from South Dakota to Missouri, Illinois, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and Idaho. Yet McGovern excelled at flight school and became a skilled pilot. He earned many decorations including the Distinguished Flying Cross for saving the lives of his crew.</p><p><i>My Life in the Service</i> provides a lively and intimate glimpse into the Allied bombing of Nazi-occupied Europe. The B-24, nicknamed the &#x201c;Flying Coffin,&#x201d; was unwieldy, uncomfortable, and, as McGovern himself learned, unreliable. &#x201c;Needless to say old terra firma felt pretty good,&#x201d; McGovern wrote after one of many rough landings detailed in his diary. McGovern endured dangerous weather, tire blowouts, and midair engine losses. He returned home without a scratch, though many of his friends were less fortunate. &#x201c;I hated like everything to see him go,&#x201d; he wrote of one who died in a crash. McGovern counted down the missions he had to complete before he returning to his hometown sweetheart, Eleanor&#x2015;they married during his service, and she gave birth to their daughter while he was overseas.</p><p>His final mission, on April 25, 1945, was the worst of them all. &#x201c;All our hydraulic lines were cut hopelessly so to land we had to crank our gear down manually, pump the flaps down, and then throw out parachutes to stop us when we were on the ground,&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;We ended up at the end of the runway O.K. with no further damage to the planes or the fellows. We had well over 75 holes in our plane&#x2015;some of which were amazingly close to some of us. In a way this was a good one to quit on because it made me more thankful than ever that I had finished.&#x201d;</p><p>That mission proved to be the last that the 15th Air Force flew. Less than two weeks later, the war ended. &#x201c;I should consider myself lucky not to have missed that one,&#x201d; McGovern wrote, with the pluck that enlivens every page of this book, &#x201c;even though it did scare the devil out of me.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p>Before he was a celebrated politician, or even a college graduate, Senator George McGovern served as a B-52 bomber pilot in World War II. Based out of Italy, McGovern flew thirty-five combat missions over German-occupied Europe from 1943-44, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross for his ingenuity in the face of adversity. After the war, Sen. McGovern returned to his family and his studies, becoming a professor of history and political science in his native South Dakota. He left the academy to enter politics full-time in 1955, beginning a decades long career by successfully bolstering the state&#x2019;s Democratic Party. Sen. McGovern was elected to Congress in 1956 and 1958, and then to the Senate in 1962, an office he would hold for eighteen years. He was the Democratic Party&#x2019;s nominee for president in 1972.</p></p><h2>Women in the Church: An Analysis and Application of 1 Timothy 2:9-15</h2><p><i>Women in the Church</i> offers a definitive statement of the complementarian interpretation of this crucial New Testament passage on the role of women in the church.

Kept in shape with an ape as you danced to a tape? Do you know a dragon, so scaly and red? And, would you look after him when he's sick in bed? Meet a little girl and her charming animals as they play all day. She spins round with her hippo, blows bubbles in the bath with giraffe, picnics on brown bread and honey with her bear when it's sunny. And, did you ever meet a leopard in top hat and tail? He's simply the best, as anyone can see! It's the most delightful menagerie imaginable, and the sweetest story-with a little twist at the end!<br></p><p>A spunky preschooler proves she's learned an important life lesson: it's who you know that counts. "I know a Rhino/ We like to take tea," she informs readers, as the huge horned beast daintily pours out a pot and a tiny stool collapses beneath his weight. "I have two sugars/ and Rhino has three." The seven other animals making up her unusual circle include an illness-prone dragon and a leopard with a penchant for formal wear. What's more, as the narrator reveals in the final page, the members of this motley menagerie aren't mere acquaintances; all of them "live with me!" (as beloved stuffed toys that the girl snuggles with as she sleeps). While not quite up to the unfettered goofiness of his Sometimes I Like to Curl Up Like a Ball, Fuge still conveys humor and good cheer with full-bleed spreads that capitalize on the animals' various attributes (one turns vertical when the girl introduces a bubble-bath loving giraffe). He furnishes the stage-like scenes with minimal bright, monochromatic backdrops, keeping the focus on the animal guests' often overwhelming size and elaborate texture. Rhino's portrait, for example, emphasizes the folds of ample flesh that hang over its ribs. Preschoolers will delight in the zoologically incorrect situations put forth by the pert heroine. Ages 3-6.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.PreS. This vivid rhyming picture book captures a child at imaginary play. It begins: "I know a rhino. / We like to take tea. / I have two sugars / and rhino has three," and the lovely picture shows a gigantic rhinoceros sharing a child-size table and chairs with a little girl. He has his legs crossed, and he pours the tea with perfect manners for a perfect tea party. The text continues in the same vein as the little girl plays in the mud with a pig, dances with an orangutan, twirls with a hippo, acts as vet for a sick dragon, bathes with a giraffe, picnics with a bear, and plays dress-up with a leopard. The scenarios are all bright fun, and the ending is particularly satisfying as the child curls up in bed with her toy animal friends. This will be a nice read-aloud for young children; the large print and easy poetry will also entice brand-new readers to try the pages on their own. <i>Kathy Broderick</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Hubbell&#39;s calm, tongue-firmly-in-cheek prose is a great delight.Hubbell (A Book of Bees), formerly a regular contributor to the New Yorker, deals with a variety of subjects in this collection of entertaining and informative essays previously published separately. Because she traveled widely in her three-quarter-ton pickup delivering the honey she made on her Ozark farm, several of Hubbell's pieces evoke life at truck stops and in the small towns she passed through. In "The Great American Pie Expedition," she describes the mouthwatering, summer-long odyssey across the U.S. she embarked on in search of the best restaurant pies and concludes, "Never eat pie within one mile of an interstate highway." In other articles, she interviews a woman who recently sighted Elvis, examines the state of five-and-dime stores, visits a magicians' convention and shares her love of the outdoors. Hubbell's ready wit is never caustic, and she reports on her country and its citizens with curiosity and respect.

Anne Boyd Rioux has brought the novelist Constance Fenimore Woolson back to life for us. Hurrah!" &#x2015;Robert D. Richardson, author of the Bancroft Prize&#x2013;winning <em>William James: In the Maelstrom of American Modernism</em></strong></p><p>Constance Fenimore Woolson (1840&#x2013;1894), who contributed to Henry James&#x2019;s conception of his heroine Isabelle Archer in <em>The Portrait of a Lady</em>, was one of the most accomplished American writers of the nineteenth century. Yet today the best-known (and most-misunderstood) facts of her life are her relationship with James and her probable suicide in Venice. This first full-length biography of Woolson provides a fuller picture that reaffirms her literary stature.</p><p>Uncovering new sources, Anne Boyd Rioux evokes Woolson&#x2019;s dramatic life. She was a grand-niece of James Fenimore Cooper and was born in New Hampshire, but her family&#x2019;s ill fortunes drove them west to Cleveland. Raised to be a conventional woman, Woolson was nonetheless thrust by her father&#x2019;s death into the role of breadwinner, and yet, as a writer, she reached for critical as much as monetary reward.</p><p>Known for her powerfully realistic and empathetic portraits of post Civil&#x2013;War American life, Woolson created compelling and subtle portrayals of the rural Midwest, Reconstruction-era South, and the formerly Spanish Florida, to which she traveled with her invalid mother. After her mother&#x2019;s death, Woolson, with help from her sister, moved to Europe where expenses were lower, living mostly in England and Italy and spending several months in Egypt. While abroad, she wrote finely crafted foreign-set stories that presage Edith Wharton&#x2019;s work of the next generation.</p><p>In this rich biography, Rioux reveals an exceptionally gifted and committed artist who pursued and received serious recognition despite the difficulties faced by female authors of her day. Throughout, Rioux goes deep into Woolson&#x2019;s character, her fight against depression, her sources for writing, and her intimate friendships, including with Henry James, painting an engrossing portrait of a woman and writer who deserves to be more widely known today.</p> 34 illustrations</p><p>Anne Boyd Rioux, a professor at the University of New Orleans, is the author of Constance Fenimore Woolson: Portrait of a Lady Novelist and Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy: The Story of Little Women and Why It Still Matters, and the editor of Woolson&#x2019;s Miss Grief and Other Stories. Rioux has received two National Endowment for the Humanities Awards, one for public scholarship, and lives in New Orleans.&#x201c;[It&#x2019;s] galling that most who remember [Woolson] today do so in connection with Henry James, who occupied murky territory somewhere between frenemy and soulmate.

M. Forster, and Willa Cather, and who arguably might be hailed in the same breath as Henry James and George Eliot. . . .

But no: the third party in our <i>m�nage � trois</i> turns out to be a surprise to him after all these years, and he needs more time to think about it.</p><p>Bending over backwards to give him the benefit of the doubt, this has only become an issue since my husband acquired the ability to see Lecter&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what I call my violin when I argue with him*&#x2014;for what he is. (He. She. It. <i>Whatever.</i>) Bob is very unusual in having lately developed this ability: it marks him as a member of a privileged elite, the select club of occult practitioners who can recognize what they&#x2019;re in the presence of and stand fast against it rather than fleeing screaming into the night. Like the Vampire Bitch from Human Resources, and what was <i>she</i> doing in the living room at five o&#x2019;clock in the morning&#x2014;?</p><p><i>Issues.</i> Vampires, violins, and marital miscommunications. I&#x2019;m going off-topic again, aren&#x2019;t I? Time out for tea!</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p><i>Take three.</i></p><p>Hello.</p><p>My name is Mo; that&#x2019;s short for Dominique O&#x2019;Brien. I&#x2019;m forty-three years old, married to a man who calls himself Bob Howard, aged thirty-eight and a quarter. We are currently separated while we try to sort things out&#x2014;things including, but not limited to: my relationship with my violin, his relationship with the Vampire Bitch from Human Resources, and the End Of The World As We Know It (which is an ongoing work-related headache).</p><p>This is my introduction to my work journal during OPERATION INCORRIGIBLE, and the period immediately before and after it. We&#x2019;re supposed to keep these journals in order to facilitate institutional knowledge retention in event of our death in the line of duty. And if you are reading it, you are probably a new Laundry recruit and I am probably not on hand to brief you in person because I&#x2019;m dead.</p><p>Now, you might be wondering why this journal is so large. I could soft-soap you and claim that I just wanted to leave you with a full and balanced perspective on the events surrounding OPERATION INCORRIGIBLE&#x2014;it&#x2019;s certainly a valid half-truth&#x2014;but the real reason is that I&#x2019;ve been under a lot of stress lately. Nervous breakdowns are a luxury item that we don&#x2019;t have time for right now, and anyway, all our security-cleared therapists are booked up eight months in advance: so the only psychotherapy I&#x2019;m getting is the DIY kind, and pouring it all out into a private diary that&#x2019;s going to be classified up to its armpits and buried in a TOP SECRET vault guarded by security zombies until I&#x2019;m too dead to be embarrassed by it seemed like a good compromise. So I wrote it this way, and I don&#x2019;t have the time (or inclination, frankly) to go back and take all the personal stuff out: duty calls, etcetera, and you&#x2019;ll just have to suck it up.</p><p>If I were Bob, this journal would probably claim to be written by &#x201c;Sabine Braveheart&#x201d; or some such nonsense, but after OPERATION INCORRIGIBLE my patience with silly pseudonyms is at an all-time low. So I&#x2019;ll use pseudonyms where necessary to protect high-clearance covert assets, and for people who insist on hiding under rocks&#x2014;yes, Bob, if you&#x2019;re reading this I&#x2019;m talking about you&#x2014;but the rest of the time I&#x2019;ll call a spade a bloody shovel, not EARTHMOVER CRIMSON VORTEX.</p><p>Anyway, you got this far so let me finish the prelude to the intro by adding that if you can get past all the <i>Bridget Jones meets The Apocalypse</i> stuff you might pick up some useful workplace tips. (To say nothing of the juicy office gossip.)</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Now, to the subject matter at hand (feel free to skip the rest of this foreword if you already know it all):*</p><p>Bob and I are operatives working for an obscure department of the British civil service, known to its inmates&#x2014;of whom you are now one&#x2014;as the Laundry. We&#x2019;re based in London. To family and friends, we&#x2019;re civil servants; Bob works in IT, while I have a part-time consultancy post and also teach theory and philosophy of music at Birkbeck College. In actual fact, Bob is a computational demonologist turned necromancer, and I am a combat epistemologist. (It&#x2019;s my job to study hostile philosophies, and disrupt them. Don&#x2019;t ask; it&#x2019;ll all become clear later.)</p><p>I also play the violin.</p><p>A brief recap: <i>magic</i> is the name given to the practice of manipulating the ultrastructure of reality by carrying out mathematical operations. We live in a multiverse, and certain operators trigger echoes in the Platonic realm of mathematical truth, echoes which can be amplified and fed back into our (and other) realities. Computers, being machines for executing mathematical operations at very high speed, are useful to us as occult engines. Likewise, some of us have the ability to carry out magical operations <i>in our own heads</i>, albeit at terrible cost.</p><p>Magic used to be rare and difficult and unsystematized. It became rather more common and easy and formal after Alan Turing put it on a sound theoretical footing at Bletchley Park during the war: for which sin, our predecessors had him bumped off during the 1950s. It was an act of epic stupidity; these days people who rediscover the core theorems are recruited and put to use by the organization.</p><p>Unfortunately, computers are <i>everywhere</i> these days&#x2014;and so are hackers, to such an extent that we have a serious human resources problem, as in: too many people to keep track of. Worse: there are not only too many computers, but too many brains. The effect of all this thinking on the structure of spacetime is damaging&#x2014;the more magic there is, the easier magic becomes, and the risk we run is that the increasing rate of thaum flux over time tends to infinity and we hit the magical singularity and ordinary people acquire godlike powers as spacetime breaks down, and then the ancient nightmares known as the Elder Gods come out to play. We in the Laundry refer to this apocalyptic situation as CASE NIGHTMARE GREEN, and it is the most immediate of the CASE NIGHTMARE RAINBOW scenarios&#x2014;existential threats to the future survival of the human species. The bad news is, due to the population crisis we&#x2019;ve been in the early stages of CASE NIGHTMARE GREEN for the past few years, and we are unlikely to be safe again before the middle of the 22nd century.</p><p>And so it is that Bob and I live a curious double life&#x2014;as boring middle-aged civil servants on the one hand, and as the nation&#x2019;s occult security service on the other.</p><p>Which brings me to the subject of OPERATION INCORRIGIBLE.</p><p>I&#x2019;m supposed to give you a full and frank account of OPERATION INCORRIGIBLE. The trouble is, my experience of it was colored by certain events of a personal nature, and although I recognize that it&#x2019;s highly unprofessional to bring one&#x2019;s private life into the office, not to mention potentially offensive and a violation of HR guidelines on respect for diversity and sexual misconduct, <i>I can&#x2019;t let it pass</i>.</p><p>Bluntly: Bob started it, and I really can&#x2019;t see any way to explain what went wrong with OPERATION INCORRIGIBLE without reference to the Vampire Bitch from HR, not to mention Her With The Gills. Or the Mayor, the nude sculpture on the Fourth Plinth, and how I blew my cover. Also: the plague of superheroes, what it&#x2019;s like to have to set up a government agency from scratch during a crisis, and the truth about what it was like to be a member of the official Home Office superhero team. And finally, the truth about my relationship with Officer Friendly.</p><p>So, Bob&#x2014;Bob? I know you&#x2019;re reading this&#x2014;you&#x2019;d better tell HR to get on the phone to RELATE and find us a marriage guidance counselor with a security clearance.</p><p>Because this is what happened, really and truly.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2.</p><p>MORNING AFTER</p><p>Business trips: I hate them.</p><p>Actually, <i>hatred</i> is too mild an emotion to encapsulate how I feel about my usual run-of-the-mill off-site work-related travel. <i>Fear and loathing</i> comes closer; I only ever get sent places when things have gotten so out of control that they need a troubleshooter. Or trouble-violinist. My typical business trips are traumatic and horrible, and leave me with nightmares and a tendency to startle at loud noises for weeks afterwards, not to mention an aversion to newspapers and TV reports on horrible incidents in far-off places. Bob is used to this. He does a wonderful job of keeping the home fires burning, providing warm cocoa and iced Scotch on demand, and over the years he&#x2019;s even learned to pretend to listen. (He&#x2019;s not very <i>good</i> at it, mind, but the gesture counts. And, to be fair, he has his own demons to wrestle with.)</p><p>But anyway: not long ago, for the first time in at least two years, I got sent on a job that didn&#x2019;t require me to confront <i>oh God, please make them stop eating the babies&#x2019; faces</i> but instead required me to attend committee meetings in nice offices, and even a couple of diplomatic receptions. So I went shopping for a little black dress and matching shoes and accessories. Then I splashed out on a new suit I could also use for work after I got back. And then I got to do the whole cocktail-hour-at-the-embassy thing for real.</p><p>Cocktail hour at the embassy consisted of lots of charming men and women in suits and LBDs drinking Buck&#x2019;s Fizz and being friendly to one another, and <i>so what</i> if half of them had gill slits and dorsal fins under the tailoring, and the embassy smelled of seaweed because it was on an officially derelict oil rig in the middle of the North Sea, and the Other Side has the technical capability to exterminate every human being within two hundred kilometers of a coastline if they think we&#x2019;ve violated the Benthic Treaty? It was <i>fun</i>. It was an officially sanctioned <i>party</i>. I was not there because my employers thought someone or something vile might need killing: I was there to add a discreet hint of muscle under the satin frock at a diplomatic reception in honor of the renewal of the non-aggression treaty between Her Majesty&#x2019;s Government and Our Friends The Deep Ones (also known as BLUE HADES).</p><p>The accommodation deck was a little utilitarian of course, even though they&#x2019;d refitted it to make the Foreign Office Xenobiology staffers feel a bit more at home. And there was a baby grand piano in the hospitality suite, although nobody was playing it (which was a good thing because it meant nobody asked me if I&#x2019;d like to accompany the pianist on violin, so I didn&#x2019;t have to explain that Lecter was indisposed because he was sleeping off a heavy blood meal in the locker under my bed).</p><p>In fact, now that I think about it, the entire week on the rig was almost entirely news-free and music-free.</p><p>And I didn&#x2019;t have any nightmares.</p><p>I&#x2019;m still a bit worried about just why I got this plum of a job at such short notice, mind you. Gerry said he needed me to stand in for Julie Warren, who has somehow contracted pneumonia and is <i>hors de combat </i>thereby. But with 20/20 hindsight, my nasty suspicious mind suggests that maybe Strings Were Pulled. The charitable interpretation is that someone in HR noticed that I was a little overwrought&#x2014;Bob left them in no doubt about <i>that</i> after the Iranian business, bless his little drama-bunny socks&#x2014;but the uncharitable interpretation&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, I&#x2019;ll get to that in a bit. Let&#x2019;s just say that if I&#x2019;d known I was going to run into Ramona, I might have had second thoughts about coming.</p><p>So, let&#x2019;s zoom in on the action, shall we?</p><p>It was Wednesday evening. We flew out to the embassy on Tuesday, and spent the following day sitting around tables in breakout groups discussing fisheries quotas, responsibility for mitigating leaks from deep-sea oil drilling sites, leasing terms for right-of-way for suboceanic cables, and liaison protocols for resolving disputes over inadvertent territorial incursions by ignorant TV production crews in midget submarines&#x2014;I&#x2019;m not making that bit up, you wouldn&#x2019;t believe how close James Cameron came to provoking World War Three. We were due to spend Thursday in more sessions and present our consensus reports on ongoing future negotiations to the ambassadors on Friday morning, before the ministers flew in to shake flippers and sign steles on the current renewal round. But on Wednesday we wrapped up at five. Our schedule gave us a couple hours to decompress and freshen up, and then there was to be a cocktail reception hosted by His Scaliness, the Ambassador to the United Kingdom from BLUE HADES.*</p><p>These negotiations weren&#x2019;t just a UK/BH affair; the UK was leading an EU delegation, so we had a sprinkling of diplomats from just about everywhere west of the Urals. (Except Switzerland, of course.) It was really a professional mixer, a meet-and-greet for the two sides. And that&#x2019;s what I was there for.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not really a diplomat, except in the sense of the term understood by General von Clausewitz. I don&#x2019;t really know anything about fisheries quotas or liaison protocols. What I was there to do was show off my pretty face in a nice frock under the nose of the BLUE HADES cultural attach�, who would then recognize me and understand the significance of External Assets detaching me from my regular circuit of <i>fuck I didn&#x2019;t know they exploded like water balloons is that green stuff blood </i>to attend a polite soir�e.</p><p>But drinking dilute bubbly and partying, for middle-aged values of partying (as Bob would put it), is a pleasant change of pace: I could get used to it. So picture me standing by the piano with a tall drink, listening to a really rather charming Chief Superintendent (on detached duty with the fisheries folks, out of uniform) spin sardonic stories about the problems he&#x2019;s having telling honest trawlermen from Russian smugglers and Portuguese fisheries pirates, when I suddenly realize I&#x2019;m <i>enjoying</i> myself, if you ignore the spot on the back of my right ankle where my shoe is rubbing&#x2014;picture me totally <i>relaxed</i>, in the moment right before reality sandbags me.</p><p>&#x201c;Mo?&#x201d; I hear, in a musical, almost liquid mezzo-soprano, rising on a note of excitement: &#x201c;Is that really <i>you</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>I begin to turn because something about the voice is tantalizingly familiar if unwelcome, and I manage to fix my face in a welcoming smile just in time because the speaker <i>is</i> familiar. &#x201c;Ramona?&#x201d; It&#x2019;s been seven years. I keep smiling. &#x201c;Long time no see!&#x201d; At this moment I&#x2019;d be happier if it was fourteen years. Or twenty-one.</p><p>&#x201c;Mo, it <i>is</i> you! You look wonderful,&#x201d; she enthuses.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, you&#x2019;re looking good yourself,&#x201d; I respond on autopilot while I try to get my p...</p></p><h2>Niemeyer</h2><p><strong>The man who built the future: Seven decades of work from the Brazilian visionary</strong> &nbsp; On the occasion of Brazilian architect <strong>Oscar Niemeyer</strong>&#x2019;s 100th anniversary, the<em> New York Times</em> wrote, <em>"In the 1940s, &#x2019;50s and &#x2019;60s he established himself as one of Modernism&#x2019;s greatest luminaries, infusing stark abstract forms with a beguiling tropical hedonism that reshaped Brazil&#x2019;s identity in the popular imagination and mesmerized architects around the globe."</em><br> <br> Until his death at age 104 in 2012, over seven decades since one of his first projects&#x2014;a 1936 collaboration with Lucio Costa and Le Corbusier&#x2014;Oscar Niemeyer was still practicing.

Eddings joins forces with his wife, Leigh, on a journey to the awesome beginning of the desperate conflict between two mortally opposed Destinies.</p><p>The age-old war was ended at last, and Destiny once again rolled on in its proper course. Only a single person remained to tell of the near-forgotten times when Gods still walked the lands, giving comfort and counsel to their mortal children. Only one man alive could speak with certain knowledge of how the Dark God Torak stole the Orb of Aldur and broke the very world apart, consigning the Gods themselves to the hell of war, along with hapless humanity. Only one individual was left who could relate the whole, fearsome story. That lone witness to history was known to all the world. He was called the Ancient One, the Old Wolf - Belgarath the Sorcerer. And he had been a part of that history from the beginning. Here, then, is his tale in full: the story of the strife that split the world asunder and of how the God Aldur and his chosen disciples would toil to set Destiny aright - a monumental undertaking fated to span the eons. Foremost in the chronicles of that labor would be Belgarath. His ceaseless devotion was foredoomed to cost him the very thing he held most dear - and his loyal service would extend on, through the echoing centuries of loss, of struggle, and of ultimate triumph.David Eddings was born in Washington State in 1931 and grew up near Seattle. He graduated from the University of Washington and went on to serve in the US Army. Subsequently, he worked as a buyer for the Boeing Aircraft Company and taught college-level English.

That man, Jack Hale, becomes her champion as he transforms her from a backwater Appalachian waif to a high-society lady. But while her tastes and expectations change, her heart remains in the Cumberland Gap. This reading expertly presents more than two dozen male and female voices that include both tough, backcountry accents and cultured, Eastern inflections.

Torn stockings and broken candy canes reveal that The Christmas Humbugs have arrived at this holiday home. But do not fear, lively rhymes and merry illustrations by Colleen and Michael Glenn Monroe lift spirits and let readers know that not even the Humbugs can dampen Christmas cheer.</p><p>Illustrator Michael Glenn Monroe has called his Christmas Humbugs out of retirement--a fuzzy bunch of tiny pranksters that first appeared in Monroe's high school sketchbooks--to take part in a fun Christmastime caper, ably recounted by Monroe's storytelling wife, Colleen.<p> Each year, the Humbugs (who look sort of like furry green grapes with wings and red jelly-bean noses) search out "cheerful houses" in which to cause mischief. But the Humbugs "aren't trying to be nasty, in fact the opposite is true, they're testing Christmas spirit and how strong it is in you." The Humbugs flit around as they break candy canes, unravel stockings, sneak peeks at Christmas packages, and even eat Santa's cookies (although "drinking Santa's ice cold milk isn't as easy as you'd think, if the Humbugs are not careful they might fall into the drink").</p><p> It's not surprising that Michael Glenn Monroe has hung onto this story for so long, given how cleverly it explains away the many frustrations of the season--and his playful details, like the Humbugs' jingle-bell antennae and red and white striped socks, reveal a Christmas spirit obviously in good working order. Colleen Monroe stays right in step with her artist husband, making fun references to "humbug rodeos" and some serious but not too smarmy asides ("The Humbugs know true spirit isn't bothered by their tricks, the tiny pranks they play take just a little time to fix").

A survey of 3,000 participants found that 2.8 percent of them suffered from binge eating disorder (BED); that women were twice as likely to report binge eating; and that BED occurs across the age span, from children to the elderly. By extrapolating the statistics to the general population, health professionals estimate 5,250,000 American women and 3,000,000 men suffer from binge eating.

BED can affect anyone, and can be caused by brain chemistry, genetic predisposition, psychology, and cultural pressures--but none of those triggers make giving in to food cravings inevitable. <i>Crave</i> helps readers understand why they crave specific foods, recognize their individual triggers, and modify their responses to those triggers. Binge eating disorder is highly treatable; 70% to 80% of patients at the UNC Eating Disorders Program triumph over their binge eating by using techniques to "curb the crave".

Dozens of special activities and fun exercises will help you communicate and get closer to your child. This guide shows you that divorce need not be an inevitable blot on children's lives, but an opportunity for them to grow and strengthen the bonds with their parents.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Kids tend to blame themselves when parents divorce. The Sandcastles workshop--now mandatory in over a dozen counties throughout the United States--is a half-day group session for children of divorce between the ages of 6 and 17. This intensive workshop helps kids open up and deal with their feelings through drawings, games, poetry, role playing, and other activities. <i>Helping Your Kids Cope with Divorce</i> details many of the workshop exercises, all designed to increase communication, understanding, and togetherness between parents and kids. The book is also packed full of suggestions on everything from the best way to break the divorce news to a child (it differs according to age group) to facing the holidays, visitation, custody arrangements, anger, discipline, co-parenting, single parenting, overcompensation, sorrow, custody fights, and much more.<p> Author Gary Neuman never patronizes or preaches, and although he is technically a child advocate, he proves himself to be an advocate of every member of the divorcing family. Neuman takes a hands-on approach and believes that children need not be permanently scarred by divorce--that with work and time, divorce can actually become a positive force for change. A powerful tool for protecting children caught amid parental struggles, <i>Helping Your Kids Cope with Divorce</i> should be required reading in <i>all</i> divorcing families. <i>--Ericka Lutz</i></p><br>"Gary Neuman has a wonderful way of nourishing parents while reminding us that there are no simple ways to help children through complicated family times. Whether we're parents, grandparents, or friends, all of us can be grateful for Gary's encouragement to be natural as we talk to--and listen to--our children. We can also be thankful for his support as we reach out for extra help when we feel we need it."<p>--Fred Rogers, creator of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood<br><br>"Of all the how-to advice about divorce on the market, the best is probably wrapped up in the book Helping Your Kids Cope with Divorce the Sandcastles Way. It's sympathetic, practical and loving; it covers all the problems faced by children of divorce; and it gives an excellent rundown of the reactions you can expect, age by age." -- The Washington Post</p></p><h2>Napoleon&#39;s Hemorrhoids: And Other Small Events That Changed History</h2><p>What were Albert Einstein&#x2019;s last words? What was Hitler&#x2019;s real name? What famous artist was mistakenly thought to be stillborn? What sport did Fidel Castro almost play professionally in America? These questions and more are answered in Napoleon&#x2019;s Hemorrhoids, a roller coaster of historical information. Napoleon&#x2019;s painful hemorrhoids prevented him from mounting his horse to survey the battlefield. Hitler&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s name was actually Shicklgruber, but when his mother remarried, he took his stepfather&#x2019;s name&#x2014;Hitler. Fidel Castro almost became a baseball player.

He is the author of Mission Accomplished! and How George Washington Fleeced the Nation. He lives in England.In this collection of historical anecdotes, author Mason illustrates how the smallest details can have far-reaching historical consequences-or at least that seems to be the idea; in execution, there is no commentary, causal connection or even source identification that legitimizes any of Mason's information (he's known as a massive collector of "cuttings and books chronicling the weird and the strange"), so while many stories are funny or remarkable, they're little better than gossip. Despite a repetitive format, Mason writes well, and readers looking for pithy historical trivia to share with friends will be satisfied. Aimed at a U.K. audience, Mason tends toward topics like British royalty and the nuances of cricket, but there's enough conversational ammunition here for a cocktail party on either side of the Atlantic. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now #1 New York Times<i> </i>bestselling author Sean Williams brings the world of the game to life in his latest novel, <b>Star Wars: The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance.</b><br><br>Tassaa Bareesh, a matriarch in the Hutt crime cartel, is holding an auction that&#x2019;s drawing attention from across the galaxy. Representatives of both the Republic and the Sith Empire are present, along with a Jedi Padawan sent to investigate, a disenfranchised trooper drummed out of the Republic&#x2019;s elite&nbsp; Blackstar Squad, and a mysterious Mandalorian with a private agenda. But the Republic&#x2019;s envoy is not what he seems, the Empire&#x2019;s delegate is a ruthless Sith apprentice, the Jedi Padawan is determined to do the right thing and terrified that he can&#x2019;t, the trooper hopes to redeem her reputation, and the Mandalorian is somehow managing to keep one step ahead of everyone.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>None of these guests&#x2014;invited or uninvited&#x2014;have any intention of participating in the auction. Instead they plan to steal the prize, which is locked inside an impregnable vault: two burned chunks of an exploded star cruiser, one of which may hold the key to the wealth of an entire world.<br><br>But the truth about the treasure is dangerous and deadly. And in the end, Sith and Jedi, Republic and Empire, must do something they&#x2019;ve never done before, something that all the agents of good and evil could never make them do: join together to stop a powerful threat that could destroy the galaxy.</p><p>New York Times bestselling author Sean Williams was born in the dry flatlands of South Australia. He still lives there with his family, forty years later, and has no plans to move anytime soon. Author of more than sixty published short stories and twenty-nine novels for readers of all ages, he has been published around the world in numerous languages, online, and in spoken-word editions. He is a judge for the Writers of the Future contest, which he won in 1993. He is also a multiple winner of Australia&#x2019;s speculative fiction awards and recently received both the Ditmar and the Aurealis for The Crooked Letter, marking the first time in the history of the awards that a fantasy novel has won both.Well back in the days of the old republic, smuggler Jet Nebula discovers a treasure whose present and ultimate value he cannot even begin to estimate. He soon learns that it is valuable to enough different, well-armed parties to threaten not only the peace of the galaxy but also his own life expectancy. The Hutts want it to sell to the highest bidder&#x2014;whether the crumbling republic or the rising empire, they don't care. The Sith, all two of them, have their own plans. So does the Jedi high council, with more scruples but greater numbers behind them. A Mandalorian seems to see in the find a clue to a long-unsolved and quite dire crime, while a spy of indeterminate loyalties plays all sides at once, which hints strongly of knowledge of what the mystery object really is. This novel is tied in to the Star Wars universe at a stage in its history that is still being explored in print fiction, and it is also the prequel to what promises to be the largest, most ambitious electronic role-playing game yet to be spun off of that universe. With so much riding on its shoulders, the book demands an unusual gift for cracking good space opera, and that Williams possesses in full measure. --Roland Green</p><h2>Watercolour painting: The Ron Ranson technique</h2><p>Hundreds of photos reveal Ron Ranson&#39;s approach to watercolor.</p><p></p><h2>Modeling With NLP</h2><p>The hard cover version is not available any more.

Their relationship grows increasingly strained and Lester befriends the town's gas station owner, and damaged former hockey star Jimmy Lebeuf. The two escape into a private fantasy world of super-heroes, alien invaders and good old-fashioned pond Hockey. <i>Tales from the Farm</i> is the first volume in a trilogy of graphic novels set in a fictionalized version of Lemire's hometown of Essex County, Ontario.</li></ul></p><p><b>Jeff Lemire</b>&nbsp;is a prolific, award-winning comic book writer and artist from Ontario, who's known for creating literary stories depicting the frailties, fears, and hopes of the human condition.<br><br>He's worked extensively with all the major comic book publishers, penning well-received runs on&nbsp;<i>Animal Man</i>,&nbsp;<i>Green Arrow</i>,&nbsp;<i>Hawkeye</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Old Man Logan</i>&nbsp;for DC and Marvel.

Ken tries his best to reach out to his nephew but can't relate to this boy who wears a superhero cape and prefers reading comics to watching hockey on television. Lester spends most of his time by himself until he makes a friend with the least likely of characters: Jimmy, a disgraced pro hockey player who now runs the convenience store at the local gas station. Jimmy enters Lester's imaginary world by helping him build a fort to stave off an alien invasion and encouraging him to write and draw his own comic book. The bond that grows between the two helps both Lester and Jimmy move beyond the tragedies life gave them. Lemire's writing nails that complicated mixture of anger and sadness that comes with losing a loved one. His black-and-white illustrations work equally well, using rough and chunky lines to powerfully re-create the solitary nature of farm life and Lester's vivid imagination. Teens will love the humor in Lester's odd imagination and will be touched by the heart of a book that delivers a compelling look at tragedy and how to move on after it strikes. --School Library Journal<br><br>Stop me if you've heard this one: a young boy on a farm discovers he can fly. That the boy is only daydreaming is where Jeff Lemire's Tales from the Farm departs from more familiar comics territory and instead charts its own terrain of family, fantasies, and the realities of growing up in rural Canada.<br><br>The hero of this black-and-white graphic novel is Lester, a 10-year-old boy growing up on a farm in southwestern Ontario. Ever since his mom died, Lester has been left in the care of his Uncle Ken, a kindhearted man who is unequipped to deal with his new household charge. Lester has also been wearing a mask and cape as he disappears into the dream worlds of his comic books.<br><br>Their lives are transformed after Lester meets a different sort of hero, a former hockey star named Jimmy Lebeuf, now a local gas-station attendant thanks to a head injury received in his first (and only) pro game. Their unlikely friendship forms the heart of Lemire's story, one that mixes visions of rural life with alien invasions and pond hockey.<br><br>Lemire captures the beauty of the rural landscape in his stark compositions. There's good pacing too, matching the rhythm of the seasons, with whole pages devoted to pauses between scenes. Lemire has a knack for creating memorable characters through both look and dialogue, such as the hoser-mouthed, pug-nosed mug of Lebeuf. A lot of this comes from the drawing style, full of highly distinctive and emotive lines that go from chunky wedges to scratches. For the most part this works, although in some panels more care should have been taken, as the messiness takes away from the effect.<br><br>But overall, these tremulous lines pull you into the fragile world of childhood. The end result is a deceptively simple but tightly focused story about imagination and the yearning to be whole. --Quill &amp; Quire<br><br>In this heartfelt and beautifully sparse tale of an orphaned ten-year-old named Lester, Jeff Lemire uses an illustration style that perfectly captures the wide open spaces of rural Ontario. After Lester's mother dies, he's sent to live on his uncle's farm. He hardly knows his uncle and his father has long since left the scene. Lester forms a friendship with a gas station attendant named Jimmy Lebeuf who used to be a professional hockey player until a bad hit knocked him out of the game. Together, the two comics fans build a rich fantasy life revolving around the possibility of an alien invasion. In a watermark grayscale, Lemire also provides flashbacks to both Lebeuf's career and the details surrounding the death of Lester's mother. Another section, showing pages from Lester's own home-made comic book, is imaginative and funny.<br><br>The book has four parts, corresponding to the four seasons, and beginning with winter. If there wasn't a word spoken in this understated and genuinely moving tale, readers would still appreciate the strength and off-hand precision of Lemire's landscapes. From fields to farm equipment to the simple shapes of a gas station, Lemire manages to find the essence of each object and somehow give it an emphasis that makes you see it with fresh eyes. Tales From the Farm often has the same effect as the best black-and-white photography: making you focus in on what matters. --Jeff Vandermeer, Bookslut</p><h2>Dark Ladies: &#39;Conjure Wife&#39; and &#39;Our Lady of Darkness&#39;</h2><p><i>Conjure Wife</i><br><br>Witchcraft.

Even many symptoms of arthritis can be eased, along with TMJ, severe migraine headaches, asthma attacks, and repetitive stress injuries. In this natural, head to foot guide to musculoskeletal pain, Pete Egoscue demonstrates that the body is designed to maintain and renew itself through adequate and correct motion, and then leads the reader through brief sequences of motion<i>cises</i> matched to each pain symptom, combatting the root cause of the pain: motion starvation. Each chapter covers a portion of the body vulnerable to chronic pain, leading the reader through the movements that ultimately solve the pain problem, without resorting to drugs, traumatic surgery or expensive physical therapy.</p><p>Pete Egoscue learned a lot about pain when, as a Marine officer, he was wounded in Vietnam. He segued from patient to physical therapist, and now runs a famous clinic in San Diego, where he claims he&#39;s helped 95 percent of his patients cure chronic pain--including Jack Nicklaus and Charles Barkley, whose athletic careers he helped prolong. At the heart of his program are stretches and motion exercises to restore proper function to muscles and joints. His methods are often surprising and counterintuitive. For example, for foot pain, he suggests a series of hip exercises. In fact, this is one of the most startling books you&#39;ll read about the human organism. Egoscue has strong opinions about how modern life is changing the way our bodies function, reducing the tasks we must perform and thus reducing the functional range of motion of our muscles and joints. Fortunately, he offers movement exercises to restore what nature meant us to have.STARTING TODAY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN PAIN<p>That is the revolutionary message of this breakthrough system for eliminating chronic pain without drugs, surgery, or expensive physical therapy.

Five thousand of the inhabitants of Alpha are human refugees from the now derelict Reunion Station. They have seen this scenario before, when a single <i>kyo </i>ship swooped into the Reunion system and, without a word, melted a major section of Reunion Station with a single pass. These refugees, who were rescued through the combined efforts of an allied group of humans and <i>atevi </i>and brought to safety at Alpha, are now desperate with fear.<br><br>Bren Cameron&#x2014;brilliant human emissary of Tabini-aiji, the powerful <i>atevi </i>political leader on the mainland below, and also the appointee of the human president of the island nation of Mospheira&#x2014;is the obvious choice of representative to be sent up to deal with both the panicked refugees and the incoming alien ship.<br><br>As a member of the spacefaring delegation who rescued the refugees, Bren has talked to <i>kyo </i>before&#x2014;and even won their trust by saving one of their kind from a Reunioner prison. Because of his remarkable diplomatic and linguistic abilities, Bren managed to communicate with that grateful <i>kyo</i> individual on a limited basis, and he has evidence that that same <i>kyo </i>is on the ship heading to defenseless Alpha Station.<br><br>But no one can predict what an alien race might do, or what their motivations could be.<br><br>And Bren Cameron, the only human ever to be accepted into <i>atevi</i> society, is now the one individual with a hope of successfully interacting with the crew of the incoming ship.

The indicator above the doors showed their approach to the change-point, the cross-over, where the human side of the station met the atevi side and did face-to-face business. A schematic to the right of the door showed a second lift, outbound from the docking bay, destined for the same stop.<br><br> That lift bore a very welcome envoy from the Earth below.<br><br> On the Earth of the atevi&#x2014;humans did not predominate. But on the station&#x2014;it was supposed to be a treaty-set balance.<br><br> It had gotten out of balance. And that was only <i>one</i> problem he needed to solve in the near future. The <i>very</i> near future.<br><br> Bren Cameron kept a precautionary grip on the safety bar&#x2014;not being a citizen of the station, not being familiar with the route, he remained wary of surprises from the lift system. He wore court dress for the occasion, as a lord of the atevi aishi-di&#x2019;tat, which he was. Not that the arriving party would care. But the occasion called for dignity. Respect. For him that meant brocade and lace.<br><br> Around him, his atevi bodyguards, black-skinned and golden-eyed, towered a head taller, armed and watchful. Wherever he went, they went, black-uniformed, constantly in contact with atevi authority, who could amplify their small force considerably on short notice.<br><br> Banichi and Jago, Tano and Algini&#x2014;that team of four was the heart of his own household. Two more of the Assassins&#x2019; Guild attended him on this occasion, one man from the aiji-dowager, who was in charge of the mission; and one from Lord Geigi&#x2019;s bodyguard, as a guide through station systems and a personal gesture of support from Geigi, who had been on duty shift after shift as atevi stationmaster in Central&#x2014;control of which was supposed to rotate between human and atevi every two shifts, and pass politely between the two authorities.<br><br> That rotation had happened like clockwork for years&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. until&#x2014;God, what was it? Five? Six?&#x2014;days ago, when outside events hurtled the world toward a meeting they didn&#x2019;t want under the best of circumstances. The alien and extremely dangerous kyo had arrived insystem and were now heading toward the inner solar system, presumably for a visit.<br><br> Presumably being the operative word. The kyo were already at war. Not with them, but with someone, and it <i>was</i> a concern&#x2014;on two fronts. They <i>hoped</i> it was actually the kyo visiting them and not the unknown Someone. And they had aboard the station five thousand survivors from the other human station&#x2014;Reunion&#x2014;which had run afoul of what was indisputably a kyo attack. The kyo had had second thoughts afterward. They had allowed the evacuation of the survivors and promised peace.<br><br> One truly hoped that understanding had held up.<br><br> And with news that the kyo were inbound, the Mospheiran-born stationmaster, Mikas Tillington, had gone berserk, locked down the Reunioner sections of the human side of the station, and refused to release control of Central to atevi on their regular rotation. Mikas Tillington had put himself in sole control. Mikas Tillington had determined he was <i>not</i> going to turn decision-making over to his atevi allies, not with this emergency bearing down on them, and he had emphatically refused to trust the Reunioners, who had come in as outsiders and a problem to his organized station operations, even to be free to walk the station corridors.<br><br> The Reunioners hadn&#x2019;t been treated well by Tillington&#x2019;s administration, and they were now panicked out of all reason.<br><br> Well, Tillington could lock the Reunioners into their sections, but not even he had dared lock the atevi shuttle out of dock. And that atevi shuttle had brought up not only Bren Cameron, human translator for Tabini-aiji, head of the atevi government, but also Tabini&#x2019;s grandmother the aiji-dowager, and the aiji&#x2019;s nine-year-old son, with staff and security, who brought the certain word that atevi intended to be in charge of contact with the kyo&#x2014;and determined that they also would be in charge of the station, given the meltdown of the human-side stationmaster.<br><br> Once aboard, Bren, armed with a mandate from the Mospheiran president and the support of two of the four <i>Phoenix</i> captains, had walked into Central, ousted Tillington and shifted control to the atevi control center.<br><br> Tillington having refused to negotiate at that point, Bren had locked Tillington in his own apartment under house arrest and set the atevi-side stationmaster, Lord Geigi, on watch and watch with his crew, all this pending the arrival of the shuttle bearing Tillington&#x2019;s replacement.<br><br> Also in custody, now, given a rapidly worsening situation in the locked sections, was the self-appointed leader of the Reunioners, one Louis Baynes Braddock, the former Reunion stationmaster, currently the primary troublemaker among the refugees. Braddock was Pilots&#x2019; Guild, which in the distant past had run the ship. He claimed authority, he had ruled Reunion for over a decade, and, with Reunion lost, he had delusions of taking command here&#x2014;a command that might never have gained followers, had it not been for Tillington&#x2019;s hate campaign against the Reunioners.<br><br> With the kyo approaching and the Reunioners in a state of panic, Braddock had made his move&#x2014;and landed likewise under arrest.<br><br> It was not a good time for a civil war.<br><br> And with the four <i>Phoenix</i> captains themselves split two and two&#x2014;two having backed Tillington and two vehemently opposed&#x2014;it was time for the two powers of Earth to step in and inform the authorities in space what <i>they</i> intended to do about that rapidly approaching ship.<br><br> Two powers controlled the planet: the aishidi&#x2019;tat and its leader Tabini-aiji, who owned all but one of the shuttles that kept the station going, and the President of the island of Mospheira, where humans had found refuge from the original quarrel that had split colonists from ship-folk&#x2014;and where they had lived and built for two hundred years, below a dead and moth-balled station in orbit, never expecting <i>Phoenix</i> would return.<br><br> Never expecting <i>Phoenix</i> would have created another human station in another species&#x2019; claimed territory.<br><br> Certainly never expecting that a ship from that species would be coming in on <i>Phoenix</i>&#x2019;s trail with a purpose yet to be determined.<br><br> Tabini-aiji had sent Bren Cameron up to deal with the impending visitors by whatever means he found necessary. Necessity thus far had included the forceful removal of Tillington from Central, and the arrest of Braddock and his followers.<br><br> The President of Mospheira was also moving fast. He had quickly launched Mospheira&#x2019;s only shuttle and sent a replacement for Tillington, a unilateral appointment, with no reference to the Mospheiran legislature.<br><br> A good thing, in Bren&#x2019;s opinion. He <i>needed</i> help, someone to take the reins of the human-side operation, Mospheiran <i>and</i> Reunioner, because the <i>Phoenix </i>captains weren&#x2019;t in a position to do it, the atevi authority <i>shouldn&#x2019;t</i> do it, and <i>he</i> had his hands full with what was coming in on them from outside the solar system.<br><br> The current time was first-shift, a fact completely irrelevant to Bren&#x2019;s sleep-deprived body. The crisis of the moment had determined his schedule ever since he&#x2019;d come aboard. He was currently operating on three hours of sleep. He&#x2019;d had tea and toast for a breakfast, issued a few housekeeping orders, cleared small details left from yesterday, slipped into a good coat, and set out, desperately relieved to know that the shuttle was here, and to know that Tillington and his authority was officially and indisputably replaced, not by his hands alone.<br><br> More, he knew the replacement. Dr. Virginia Kroger. Gin. Robotics. Systems. And experienced in management. He&#x2019;d worked with her. So had the Captains. So had Geigi. And he was beyond ready to shed the problem of the station&#x2019;s unrest and take on what he was here to do, which was to deal with the incoming ship&#x2014;to take up where negotiations with the kyo at Reunion had broken off, and lay the groundwork for real communication with the people of that incoming ship, far beyond the handful of words they&#x2019;d established the last time they&#x2019;d met. He needed to find out exactly why the kyo were here and what they wanted, beyond their enigmatic pronouncement back at Reunion that they <i>would</i> visit.<br><br> Most of all he had to bring the negotiation to a point that didn&#x2019;t lead to them joining the kyo&#x2019;s war, or seeing the kyo&#x2019;s enemies turn up here. And he had to do it without accidentally triggering a kyo attack on Alpha, the way the kyo had taken out Reunion Station.<br><br> The situation with the kyo was delicate and moment to moment already. There was no way to predict when the polite echo, station to kyo ship and back again, of the kyo&#x2019;s last transmission, <i>Prakuyo come</i>, would change. If it did, when it did, atevi Central would buzz him, asking him please translate and come up with a response that wouldn&#x2019;t send the entire encounter spiraling out of control.<br><br> He needed, badly, to leave all station politics in the hands of sane people, and withdraw to his apartment, get a full night&#x2019;s sleep, and wake with his mind fully focused on the kyo problem.<br><br>Please God that Gin could keep the station quiet. <br><br>And that he could come up with answers.<br> &nbsp;<br>One had to be very, very quiet getting up this morning. Great-grandmother was resting in her private rooms in the apartment. Cajeiri, aged fortunate nine, dressed with the help of two of his bodyguards, while his guest Irene, who had slept apart, dressed with the help of his other two.<br><br> It had to be yesterday&#x2019;s clothes for Irene: that was all Irene had brought away when she had escaped the Reunioner sections. But staff would have cleaned her clothes during the night, everything taken in stride. From some source, last night, one of the servants had provided Irene a rather too large sleeping-robe. And his own bodyguards had provided her a proper place to sleep.<br><br>Irene&#x2019;s hair, which had been gold, now was not. She had cut it right at the roots, so now it was very short, black, curly, and just showed random gold tips all over, which made, Cajeiri thought, a really pretty effect.<br><br> Shortly after nand&#x2019; Bren had arrived on the station, she had done that to her hair, put on atevi clothes, stolen a key, slipped out of her mother&#x2019;s apartment and gone straight to the ship-folk door guards, speaking only Ragi, which of course they could not in the least understand.<br><br> The guards who barred her way might have suspected she was not atevi, but atevi dress was not something humans could easily lay hands on, so it had been clear she was somebody. The guards had had to ask authority, and their going to authority meant that word had gotten to Jase-aiji, who was the third- highest of the ship-aijiin. Nand&#x2019; Jase had immediately taken Irene in hand and brought her to nand&#x2019; Bren. The very topmost ship- folk authority, Ogun-aiji, had declined to stop Jase-aiji doing that&#x2014;because everybody knew that those three human children, who had gone down to Earth to visit the aiji&#x2019;s son, were under the protection of the aishidi&#x2019;tat.<br><br> They had always agreed, Cajeiri and his young associates, that if there was ever any trouble or they felt they were in danger, they should all get to the station maintenance tunnels and go straight over to the atevi half of the station and ask for Lord Geigi. So when the news had spread that the kyo were coming and Tillington-aiji was locking down the Reunioner sections, Bjorn and Artur and Gene had done just that, but that move had only gotten them trapped in the tunnels as <i>they</i> locked, so they had been stuck where they were.<br><br> But Irene had never gone to the tunnels. The Reunioner stationmaster, Braddock, who was causing all the trouble, had taken up residence in the apartment next to Irene&#x2019;s, and Braddock&#x2019;s people had locked Irene in, trapping her, as he&#x2019;d also hoped to trap Bjorn and Artur and Gene, so Braddock could hold them to negotiate with in the emergency, all because they were under that special protection.<br><br> So Irene, being both brave and clever, had made a second plan. She had kept her atevi clothing that she had worn home from her visit to the world, and once she was sure from what Braddock&#x2019;s people said that nand&#x2019; Bren was on the station, she had waited until people were asleep, then taken scissors and cut her hair, put on the clothing she had kept, <i>and </i>taken her mother&#x2019;s master key, <i>and</i> walked right up to the ship-folk guards like a lord of the aishidi&#x2019;tat.<br><br> Then she had told nand&#x2019; Jase and nand&#x2019; Bren exactly where Braddock was, and <i>that </i>had let nand&#x2019; Bren and nand&#x2019; Jase move to capture Braddock and take control of the Reunion sections by way of the tunnels, without anyone getting hurt.<br><br> It had been a brave move on Irene&#x2019;s part. If the ship-folk had returned her to her apartment, she would never have gotten away twice, and her mother would have been very angry. But Irene had not lost her nerve, and even if the guards had been sure she could not be atevi caught on the wrong side of those locked doors, she had kept using names like Lord Geigi over and over, and saying that she was under the protection of the aiji in Shejidan&#x2014;which she was. So even if the guards were absolutely sure she was human, and even if they might not have understood what she was telling them about the aiji in Shejidan, everybody on the station knew Geigi&#x2019;s name, and the guards had certainly known those clothes were not station clothes. Everybody definitely knew three Reunioners had been to the world and back.<br><br> So the guards had <i>had</i> to ask somebody what to do about Irene.<br><br> Now Irene&#x2019;s mother and Braddock were both under arrest. They were locked up for security reasons, but they might get out again someday. And if they did, they probably would find out who had told nand&#x2019; Jase where to find them. That might make life very unpleasant for Irene.<br><br> One could not, would not, let that happen. Not to Irene and not to any of his human associates. Cajeiri was resolved on that. They would never, ever be in a position where Braddock could threaten them again.<br><br> Gene and Artur and Bjorn and Gene&#x2019;s mother had all been found safe, rescued out of the tunnels. Then atevi security had gone in to get Bjorn&#x2019;s parents and Artur&#x2019;s out of the closed sections, because they might be in danger from Braddock&#x2019;s people. They were not safe to be put into Mospheiran residency&#x2014;because Mospheirans and Reunioners were at odds. There was certainly no place for them among the ship-folk. So all of them were guests on the atevi side now, under Lord Geigi&#x2019;s personal protection. They had spent last night just down the hall, in Lord Geigi&#x2019;s guest quarters. Things were still very desperate in the Reunioner section, and the big section doors were still shut and guarded, but this morning Gene and Artur and Bjorn and their parents would all be waking up safe, to a good breakfast, right down the hall from Great-grandmother&#x2019;s apartment. And they owed Irene thanks for all of it.<br><br> But for the same reasons, Irene had no mother able to see to her now, because her mother had taken up with Braddock&#x2019;s pe...</p><h2>Monsoon</h2><p>674 pages of excellent text. Set at the dawn of 18th century England, Monsoon is an exhilarating adventure pitting brother against brother, man against the sea, and good against evil. First Edition.</p><p>South Africa's master storyteller Wilbur Smith has been writing his exotic historical sagas for so long that he's in danger of being taken for granted and typecast as an author of adventure stories for and about overgrown boys. But there's a lot more to Smith's books than mere blood, thunder, swash, and buckle. He might not be as thoughtful or as philosophical as Patrick O'Brian, but his stories have a wider geographical and chronological range and lots more action. <p> <i>Monsoon</i> is the latest chronicle in Smith's Courteney series. In it, Hal Courteney is sent by the East India Trading Company to attack Arab pirates who are harassing trade off the East African coast. He takes three of his four sons, but one of them absconds to Bombay and another is taken prisoner by the Arabs. </p><p> Like his heroes, Smith's prose pulls no punches: "Aboli swung the axe in a wide, flashing arc. It took the man full in the side of his neck, severing it cleanly. His head toppled forward and rolled down his chest, while his trunk stood erect before it slumped to the deck. The air escaped from his lungs in a whistling blast of frothy blood from the open windpipe." It may not be pretty, but it certainly grabs your attention. <i>--Dick Adler</i> <em>--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.</em></p>Praise for Wilbur Smith:<p> "Smith's novel is far more than your typical pirate script.... A fascinating account...Smith deftly evokes not only the horrific but also the beautiful, particularly the lush landscape of Africa." --<i>The Washington Post Book World</i> on <i>Birds of Prey</i></p><p> "As usual, Smith...peoples his tale with unforgettable characters....Swashbuckling and sensuous, <i>Birds of Prey</i> is not for the faint-hearted. Its bloodiest scenes are vivid and detailed--and so are hero Hal's romantic encounters. But, as with Smith's previous two bestsellers, <i>River God</i> and <i>The Seventh Scroll</i>, this latest epic transcends the average action-adventure yarn." --<i>The Orlando Sentinel</i></p><p> "<i>Birds of Prey</i> is a wonderful novel filled with excitement, pirates, and vivid sea battles....In short, it is vintage Wilbur Smith." --<i>Times Record News</i> (Wichita Falls, Texas)</p><p> "A rich, compelling look back in time [to] when history and myth intermingled." --<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> on <i>River God</i></p><p> "An epic...Smith joins the ranks of the grand masters of twentieth-century novels." --<i>Tulsa World</i> on <i>River God</i></p><p> "Throughout <i>The Seventh Scroll</i>, as in all Wilbur Smith novels, the plot twists and turns with constant surprises....This old-fashioned adventure novel keeps the reader enthralled all the way to its very exciting conclusion." --<i>The Washington Post Book World</i></p></p><h2>Plants That Never Ever Bloom (World of Nature)</h2><p>Brief rhyming text and illustrations present a variety of plants that do not flower but propagate by means of spores, seeds, and cones.</p><p>After receiving a fine arts degree from the University of California at Berkeley and completing two years of graduate work in design at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland, <b>Ruth Heller</b> (1923-2004) began her career designing wrapping paper, cocktail napkins, greeting cards, and coloring books. After five years of rejection and one complete revision, Heller's first book,&nbsp;<i>Chickens Aren't the Only Ones</i>, about egg-laying animals, was published in 1981. It was so successful that the sequel, and second book to be published,&nbsp;<i>Animals Born Alive And Well</i>&nbsp;(1982), about mammals, quickly followed. In 1983 and 1984, her third and fourth titles,&nbsp;<i>The Reason For A Flower</i>&nbsp;(about plants that have seeds and flowers) and&nbsp;<i>Plants That Never Ever Bloom</i>&nbsp;(about plants that do not) were published.<br> <br> She then began work on a collection of six books, the&nbsp;<i>How To Hide</i>&nbsp;series on camouflage and the magic of this phenomenon in nature, which covered the entire animal kingdom -- insects, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and sea creatures. The next collection of books became a five-volume series on parts of speech:&nbsp;<i>A Cache of Jewels and Other Collective Nouns; Kites Sail High: A Book About Verbs; Many Luscious Lollipops: A Book About Adjectives; Merry-Go-Round: A Book About Nouns;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Up, Up and Away: A Book About Adverbs</i>. She also wrote and illustrated the unique and fascinating book&nbsp;<i>Color</i>, a charming and instructive guide to how art goes through the four color printing process.<br> <br> Among the notable people who have had an influence on Heller's writing have been: Ogden Nash, Gilbert and Sullivan, Edward Lear, Hilaire Belloc, and Dr. Seuss. Heller says of her work, "All my books are nonfiction picture books in rhyme. I find writing in rhyme enjoyable and challenging, and I think it is an easy way for children to learn new facts and acquire a sophisticated vocabulary. Children are not intimidated by big words. I try to make my writing succinct and allow the illustrations to convey as much information as possible."</p><h2>The Three Questions: How to Discover and Master the Power Within You</h2><p><p>The beloved spiritual teacher builds on the message of his enduring <em>New York Times</em> and international bestseller <em>The Four Agreements</em> with this profound guide that takes us deeper into the tradition of Toltec wisdom, helping us find and use the hidden power within us to achieve our fullest lives.</p><p>In <em>The Four Agreements</em>, Don Miguel Ruiz introduced seekers on the path to enlightenment to the tenets of Mesoamerican spiritual culture&#x2014;the ancient Toltec.

The method used by Brunswick and Mazlish is to select twenty-five or more key persons or events and to weave the whole chronicle of Western thought from Leonardo to Heel (inclusive) around them. Their work is therefore less abstract than some histories of thought of a similar compass, since it does not hesitate to deal with specific persons and even political events: intellectual history is not reduced to themes and elements. The individual chapters, since they are really examples, present the newest learned evidence with some detail and even indicate the scholarly controversies that are involved. References to the learned literature in these essays are invariably apt...<p>Bruce Mazlish is professor emeritus of history at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and fellow of The American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

"I had to become a soldier." Jordan's fierce, funny, lyrical memoir of her first 12 years reveals the seeds of her adult poetry in her childhood experiences: the magical sounds of words in the nursery rhymes her mother crooned, the awareness nearly from birth of the bitter complexities of family relations. Jordan's father (depicted in a brilliantly nuanced portrait) was a proud Jamaican immigrant who encouraged his daughter to read and took her to museums and to Carnegie Hall, but also called her "damn black devil child" and beat her for the slightest misstep. He moved his family from a Harlem housing project to their own home in Brooklyn, enrolled June at a white boarding school, and fought savagely with his wife, who argued, "The child is a Black girl ... you gwine to make her afraid to be sheself!" Jordan reproduces the rhythms of West Indian speech as vividly as she captures African American culture of the 1930s and '40s in a poignant autobiography that, for all its racial particularity, tells an all-American story of the charged emotional legacy bequeathed by parents striving to give their children a better life. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>June Jordan is Professor of African American Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><h2>Dick and Jane: A Christmas Story</h2><p>A charming oversized picture book features Dick, Jane, Sally, Spot, and Puff as they celebrate the holidays with family and special togetherness.</p><p></p><h2>Pornography: Private Right or Public Menace?

Before writing the Academy Award-winning classic The English Patient and being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for The Talented Mr. Ripley, the late Anthony Minghella worked alongside Jim Henson to bring forgotten tales of European folklore to vivid life on television. The series debuted to critical acclaim and in deference to the tales that inspired Henson and the series, Minghella adapted the nine stories into prose. Accompanied by stunning illustrations from an array of artistic talent and style, these tales are the early work of an incredible storyteller and are part of a series of novels being printed by Archaia and the Jim Henson company that celebrate the creative spirit of Jim Henson and his collaborators. In his introduction Minghella dedicates the book and these stories to his son Max, writing, "I have tried to fill his days with their magic just as he has filled my days with his own." Now, long after taken out of print, fans can share the magic of these stories and the master storyteller who crafted them, with readers of all ages.</p><p>Jim Henson's <b>The Storyteller</b> is a book to enchant readers of all ages--inspired by the beloved guiding genius of Muppetdom and a whole world of creatures we have taken into our hearts. These nine delightfully illustrated stories, based on Henson's Emmy Award-winning television series, are fairy tales and folk tales beautifully told by Academy Award-winning director Anthony Minghella. <br> <br>They deal with the universal themes of folk literature: fear and need; folly, greed, and enchantment; courage and generosity. They are about princesses and giants, about a soldier and a brave young boy (half-hedgehog and half-human), and about a storyteller terrified that he will run out of tales. Infused with the spellbinding Henson magic, these tales, treasured by generation after generation in the Old World, come to us now with a new radiance.James Maury &#34;Jim&#34; Henson was an American puppeteer, artist, cartoonist, Imagineer, inventor, screenwriter, film director and producer, best known as the creator of The Muppets. As a puppeteer, Henson performed in various television programs, such as Sesame Street and The Muppet Show, films such as The Muppet Movie and The Great Muppet Caper, and created advanced puppets for projects like Fraggle Rock, The Dark Crystal, and Labyrinth. He was also an Academy Award-nominated film director (for his short film Time Piece), Emmy Award-winning television producer, and the founder of The Jim Henson Company, the Jim Henson Foundation, and Jim Henson&#39;s Creature Shop.</p><h2>Reminiscences of the Civil War (Collector&#39;s library of the Civil War)</h2><p>This book is a facsimile reprint and may contain imperfections such as marks, notations, marginalia and flawed pages.</p><p>John Brown Gordon (February 6, 1832 - January 9, 1904) was one of Robert E. Lee&#39;s most trusted Confederate generals during the American Civil War. After the war, he was a strong opponent of Reconstruction and is thought by some to have been the titular leader of the Ku Klux Klan in Georgia during the late 1860s. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a U.S. Senator from 1873 to 1880, and again from 1891-1897. He also served as the 53rd Governor of Georgia from 1886 to 1890.</p><h2>Ariadne&#39;s Clue: A Guide to the Symbols of Humankind</h2><p><p>Symbolism is the most powerful and ancient means of communication available to humankind. For centuries people have expressed their preoccupations and concerns through symbolism in the form of myths, stories, religions, and dreams. The meaning of symbols has long been debated among philosophers, antiquarians, theologians, and, more recently, anthropologists and psychologists. In <i>Ariadne's Clue,</i> distinguished analyst and psychiatrist Anthony Stevens explores the nature of symbols and explains how and why we create the symbols we do.</p><br><p> The book is divided into two parts: an interpretive section that concerns symbols in general and a "dictionary" that lists hundreds of symbols and explains their origins, their resemblances to other symbols, and the belief systems behind them. In the first section, Stevens takes the ideas of C. G. Jung a stage further, asserting not only that we possess an innate symbol-forming propensity that exists as a creative and integral part of our psychic make-up, but also that the human mind evolved this capacity as a result of selection pressures encountered by our species in the course of its evolutionary history. Stevens argues that symbol formation has an adaptive function: it promotes our grasp on reality and in dreams often corrects deficient modes of psychological functioning. In the second section, Stevens examines symbols under four headings: "The Physical Environment," "Culture and Psyche," "People, Animals, and Plants," and "The Body." Many of the symbols are illustrated in the book's rich variety of woodcuts. From the ancient symbol of the serpent to the archetypal masculine and feminine, from the earth to the stars, from the primordial landscape of the savannah to the mysterious depths of the sea, Stevens traces a host of common symbols back through time to reveal their psychodynamic functioning and looks at their deep-rooted effects on the lives of modern men, women, and children.</p></p><p><p>"Stevens has a unique capacity for relating myths and symbols to the way our psyches function today, thus bringing symbols alive rather than dismissing them as historical curiosities. He is also a stylish writer, and is able to link his conclusions from a variety of fields into a consistent, readable whole."<b>--Anthony Storr, University of Oxford</b></p><b>Anthony Stevens</b> has worked as a Jungian analyst and psychiatrist for the past thirty years. He is a graduate of the University of Oxford and, in addition to his medical degree, he has two degrees in psychology. His previous books include <i>Archetype: A Natural History of the Self, The Roots of War, On Jung, The Two-Million-Year-Old Self, Jung, Private Myths: Dreams and Dreaming,</i> and, with John Price, <i>Evolutionary Psychiatry: A New Beginning.</i></p><h2>Living the Resurrection: The Risen Christ in Everyday Life</h2><p>Christ's friends were utterly transformed by His resurrection.

Dr. Peterson takes you back to Jesus&#39; time so you can experience the Resurrection through the eyes of the biblical witnesses.

He also hosts his own music and interview series on Bravo.<i>Friends</i> fans around the world are mourning the end of the show's 10-year run, but they'll have this lavishly illustrated book to console them. Photographs, both from the episodes and behind-the-scenes, abound, but the many "exit interviews" will be what draws readers. Interviews with the primary six cast members, the show's creators, and some of the prominent recurring guest stars make up the majority of the text in the book. Die-hard fans might know most of the interesting tidbits--that Monica and Joey were intended to be the show's main couple, not Ross and Rachel, or that Monica and Chandler's romance was supposed to be short-lived--but some of the frank discussions in the interviews (like the other cast members' worries and frustrations over Matthew Perry's long battle with an addiction to painkillers) will intrigue passionate <i>friends</i> fans. A guest star notes that "Disneyland and the <i>friends</i> set are the two happiest places on earth," and everything the cast and creators say backs that up. Fans will seek out this fun retrospective. <i>Kristine Huntley</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Very wrong. Because Mick Foley is back with a vengeance.</p><p><em>Foley Is Good</em> picks up right where the last book left off, as once again readers are given a bird's-eye view of the behind-the-scenes action in the World Wrestling Federation. With the same total honesty and riotous humor displayed in his last book, Mick shines a spotlight into some of the hidden corners of the World Wrestling Federation. From the ongoing controversy surrounding "backyard wrestling" to the real story behind his now-infamous I Quit" match with The Rock, Foley covers all the bases in this hysterically funny roller-coaster ride of a memoir.</p><p>Some know him as Cactus Jack, others as Dude Love. We loved him as Mankind, and he was the best Commissioner the World Wrestling Federation ever had. But if you want to know the real Mick Foley, if you want to get inside the head of one of sportsentertainment's biggest Superstars, then there's no substitute for <em>Foley Is Good.</em> Readers and fans everywhere need their recommended daily allowance of pure, unadulterated Mick. And it's all right here for the taking.</p></p><p>Not only is gap-toothed Mick Foley a heavy character in the World Wrestling Federation, he is the undisputed literary champion of the wrestling bestseller. It's amazing that there is such a thing as a "wrestling bestseller," and that fact owes largely to the No. 1 bestselling success of Foley's first book, <i>Have a Nice Day!</i> Now he's back with another memoir, <i>Foley Is Good: And the Real World Is Faker Than Wrestling</i>, and fans will not be disappointed by the jokes, the jibes at fellow WWF arm-twisters, and the genial charm of the literary behemoth of our time.<p>Mick Foley is the former Commissioner of the World Wrestling Federation and one of its biggest Superstars. He loves amusement parks, is an American history buff, and can withstand more pain in one hour than most of us could in a lifetime. He is the author of two <em>New York Times bestsellers: Have a Nice Day!</em> and <em>Mick Foley's Christmas Chaos.</em> He currently lives in New York State with his wife and three children.</p></p><h2>The Creeps: A Samuel Johnson Tale (The Samuel Johnson Series)</h2><p>In this delightfully imaginative novel, once again, hell threatens to break loose as Samuel Johnson and his ragtag group of friends must defend their town from shadowy forces more threatening than ever before...<br><br>In this clever and quirky follow-up to The Gates and <i>The Infernals</i>, Samuel Johnson&#x2019;s life seems to have finally settled down&#x2014;after all, he&#x2019;s still got the company of his faithful dachshund Boswell and his bumbling demon friend Nurd; he has foiled the dreaded forces of darkness not once but twice; and he&#x2019;s now dating the lovely Lucy Highmore. <br> <br>But things in the little English town of Biddlecombe rarely run smoothly for long. Shadows are gathering in the skies; a black heart of pure evil is bubbling with revenge; and it rather looks as if the Multiverse is about to come to an end, starting with Biddlecombe. When a new toy shop&#x2019;s opening goes terrifyingly awry, Samuel must gather a ragtag band of dwarfs, policemen, and very polite monsters to face down the greatest threat the Multiverse has ever known, not to mention assorted vampires, a girl with an unnatural fondness for spiders, and highly flammable unfriendly elves.<br> <br>The latest installment of John Connolly&#x2019;s wholly original and creepily imaginative Samuel Johnson Tales, <i>The Creeps</i> is humorous horror for anyone who enjoys fiction at its best.</p><p>John Connolly is the author of the Charlie Parker series of mystery novels, the supernatural collection <i>Nocturnes,</i> the Samuel Johnson Trilogy for younger readers, and (with Jennifer Ridyard) the Chronicles of the Invaders series.

Unfortunately, as is often the case in a place in which things have been quiet for a little too long, when something interesting did happen it was very interesting indeed; more interesting, in fact, than anybody might have wished. The gates of Hell had opened in a basement in Biddlecombe, and the town had temporarily been invaded by demons.<br> <br>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Biddlecombe had never really been the same since. The rugby team no longer played on its old pitch, not since a number of its players had been eaten by burrowing sharks; the voice of the captain of the Biddlecombe Golf Club could still occasionally be heard crying out from somewhere at the bottom of the fifteenth hole; and it was rumored that a monster had taken up residence in the duck pond, although it was said to be very shy, and the ducks appeared to be rather fond of it.<br> <br>But the creature in the pond was not the only entity from Hell that had now taken up permanent residence in Biddlecombe, which brings us back to the birthday party. It was not, it must be said, a typical birthday party. The birthday boy in question was named Wormwood. He looked like a large ferret that had suffered a severe attack of mange,1 and was wearing a pair of very fetching blue overalls upon which his name had been embroidered. These overalls replaced a previous pair upon which his name had also been embroidered, although he had managed to spell his own name wrong first time round. This time, all of the letters were present and correct, and in the right order, because Samuel Johnson&#x2019;s mother had done the stitching herself, and if there was one thing Mrs. Johnson was a stickler for,2 it was good spelling. Thus it was that the overalls now read WORMWOOD and not WROMWOOD as they had previously done.<br> <br>Wormwood was, not to put too fine a point on it, a demon. He hadn&#x2019;t set out to be a demon. He&#x2019;d just popped into existence as one, and therefore hadn&#x2019;t been given a great deal of choice in the matter. He&#x2019;d never been very good at being a demon. He was too nice for it, really. Sometimes folk just end up in the wrong job.3<br> <br>A chorus of voices rang out around the kitchen table.<br> <br>&#x201c;Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday dear Woooorrrrrmmmmmwoooood, Happy Birthday to you! For he&#x2019;s a jolly good, um, fellow&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>Wormwood smiled the biggest, broadest smile of his life. He looked round the table at those whom he now thought of as his friends. There was Samuel Johnson and his dachshund, Boswell. There were Samuel&#x2019;s schoolmates Maria Mayer and Tom Hobbes. There was Mrs. Johnson, who had started to come to terms with having demons sitting at her kitchen table on a regular basis. There were Shan and Gath, two fellow demons who were employed at the local Spiggit&#x2019;s Brewery as beer tasters and developers, and who were responsible for a 50 percent increase in the brewery&#x2019;s profits, as well as a 100 percent increase in the number of explosions due to the instability of the still-experimental Spiggit&#x2019;s Brew Number 666, also known as &#x201c;The Tankbuster,&#x201d; which was rumored to be under consideration by the military as a field weapon.<br> <br>And then there was Nurd, formerly &#x201c;Nurd, the Scourge of Five Deities&#x201d; and now sometimes known as the Nurdster, the Nurdmeister, and the Nurdman, although only to Nurd himself. Nobody else ever called Nurd anything but Nurd. Nurd had once been banished to the remotest, dullest region of Hell for being annoying, and Wormwood, as his servant, had been banished with him. Now that they had found their way to Biddlecombe, Wormwood preferred to think of himself as Nurd&#x2019;s trusty assistant rather than his servant. Occasionally, Nurd liked to hit Wormwood over the head with something hard and memorable, just to remind Wormwood that he could think of himself as anything he liked just as long as he didn&#x2019;t say it aloud.<br> <br>But in the end Nurd, too, was one of Wormwood&#x2019;s friends. They had been through so much together, and now they worked alongside each other at the Biddlecombe Car Testing Institute, where Nurd tested the safety of new cars, aided by the fact that he was immortal and hence able to walk away from the worst crashes with only the occasional bruise for his trouble.<br> <br>Wormwood had never had a birthday party before. He didn&#x2019;t even know there was such a thing as a birthday until he arrived on Earth. It seemed like a very good idea to him. You got cake, and gifts, and your friends sat around and sang about what a jolly good fellow you were. It was all quite, quite splendid.<br> <br>The singing ended, and everyone sat waiting expectantly.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do I do now?&#x201d; asked Wormwood.<br> <br>&#x201c;You blow out the candles on the cake,&#x201d; said Samuel.<br> <br>When they&#x2019;d asked Wormwood how old he was, he&#x2019;d thought that he might just be a few billion years younger than the universe itself, which made him, oh, about ten billion years old.<br> <br>&#x201c;The cake&#x2019;s only a foot wide!&#x201d; Mrs. Johnson had pointed out. &#x201c;He can&#x2019;t have ten billion candles. They won&#x2019;t fit, and if we try the whole town will go up in flames.&#x201d;<br> <br>So they&#x2019;d settled on one candle for every billion years, which seemed like a reasonable compromise.<br> <br>Nurd was seated directly across the table from Wormwood. He was wearing a red paper party hat, and was trying unsuccessfully to blow up a balloon. Nurd had changed a lot in the time that they&#x2019;d been in Biddlecombe, thought Wormwood. His skin was still green, of course, but not as green as before. He now looked like someone who had just eaten a bad egg. His head, which had formerly been shaped like a crescent moon, had shrunk slightly. It was still long and odd-looking, but he was now able to walk the streets of Biddlecombe without frightening too many children or causing cars to crash, especially if he kept his head covered.<br> <br>&#x201c;This balloon appears to be broken,&#x201d; said Nurd. &#x201c;If I blow any harder, my eyes will pop out. Again.&#x201d;<br> <br>That had been embarrassing. Samuel had used a spoon to retrieve them from Nurd&#x2019;s glass of lemonade.<br> <br>Wormwood took a deep breath.<br> <br>&#x201c;Make a wish,&#x201d; said Maria. &#x201c;But you have to keep it to yourself, or else it won&#x2019;t come true.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, I think I&#x2019;ve got the hang of the balloon now,&#x201d; said Nurd.<br> <br>Wormwood closed his eyes. He made his wish. He blew. There was a loud whoosh, followed by a pop and a distinct smell of burning.<br> <br>Wormwood opened his eyes. Across the table, Nurd&#x2019;s head was on fire. In one of his hands, he held the charred, melted remains of a balloon.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, thank you,&#x201d; said Nurd as he tried to douse the flames. &#x201c;Thank you very much.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; said Wormwood. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never tried to blow anything out before.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; said Samuel. &#x201c;You have inflammable breath. I always thought it smelled like petrol.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The cake survived,&#x201d; said Tom. &#x201c;The icing has just melted a bit.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; said Nurd. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about me. I love being set alight. Keeps out the cold.&#x201d;<br> <br>Samuel patted Nurd on the back.<br> <br>&#x201c;Seriously, I&#x2019;m okay,&#x201d; said Nurd.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know. Your back was on fire, though.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a hole in your cloak, but I expect Mum will be able to fix it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mrs. Johnson cut the cake and gave everybody a slice.<br> <br>&#x201c;What did you wish for, Wormwood?&#x201d; asked Tom.<br> <br>&#x201c;And if you tell me that you wished my head was on fire, we&#x2019;ll have words,&#x201d; said Nurd.<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought I wasn&#x2019;t supposed to say,&#x201d; said Wormwood.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s before you blow,&#x201d; said Tom. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right to tell us now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I wished that everything would stay just the way it is,&#x201d; said Wormwood. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m happy here. We all are.&#x201d;<br> <br>Shan and Gath nodded.<br> <br>And in the general hilarity and good cheer that followed, nobody noticed that it was only Nurd who had not agreed.<br> <br>1. For those of you unfamiliar with mange, it is an ailment that causes a loss of fur. Think of the worst haircut you&#x2019;ve ever received, and it&#x2019;s a bit like that, but all over your body.<br> <br>2. Technically, that sentence should read &#x201c;if there was one thing for which Mrs. Johnson was a stickler,&#x201d; as nobody likes a dangling preposition, but I said that Mrs. Johnson was a stickler for good spelling, not good grammar.<br> <br>3. Such as Augustus the Second (1694&#x2013;1733), King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, also known as Augustus the Strong. He managed to bankrupt his kingdom by spending all of its money on bits of amber and ivory, lost a couple of battles that he really would have been better off winning, and fathered over three hundred children, which suggests that, in between losing battles and collecting trinkets, he had a lot of time on his hands, but his party piece consisted of gripping a horseshoe in his fists and making it straight. He would probably have been very happy just straightening horseshoes and blowing up hot-water bottles for a living, but due to an accident of birth he instead found himself ruling a number of kingdoms. Badly. You should bear this in mind if your dad or mum has a name beginning with the words &#x201c;His/Her Royal Highness,&#x201d; and you are known as &#x201c;Prince/Princess Something-or-Other.&#x201d; Unless, of course, your name is really &#x201c;Something-or-Other,&#x201d; in which case you don&#x2019;t have anything to worry about (about which to worry&#x2014;darn it) as your parents didn&#x2019;t care enough about you to give you a proper name, and you are therefore unlikely to amount to anything.

This book draws together, in Goethe's own words, his key ideas on nature, science and scientific method.</p> <p>Goethe believed that we should study our world and nature as people at home in it, rather than removedly, as if we were aliens from another planet. He adopted a qualitative approach to science at odds with Newton's quantitative methods that were so popular in his day. His is a sensitive science which does not ignore our relationship to nature.</p> <p>The extracts in this book are fascinating and essential reading for anyone who feels that we've lost our spiritual connection to nature.</p></p><p>Jeremy Naydler is a philosopher and cultural historian who lives in Oxford.

In preparing these lectures Jaspers, whom the Nazis had already dismissed from his professorship at Heidelberg, knew that he was speaking in Germany for the last time. Jaspers used the occasion to offer an account of the cultural and intellectual situation from which existentialism emerged as well as a summary of his own philosophy.</p><p>The book serves three purposes today: it brings the many strands of the existential movement into focus; it provides an overview of Jaspers's own philosophical position; and it demonstrates by example that philosophy need not be irrational, antiscientific, journalistic, or homiletic in order to be existential and <i>engag�</i>. In this short book Jaspers provides a corrective for the popular view of existentialism as a pessimistic, irrationalist philosophy. He maintains that it is, rather part of mainstream of Western philosophy&#x2014;the form that philosophy has taken in our day.</p></p><p>Karl Jaspers (1883-1969)--&#34;founder of German Existentialism&#34; (Martin Heidegger) and &#34;a lucid and flexible intelligence in the service of a genuine and passionate concern for human life&#34; (William Barrett)--is one of the great thinkers of modern times.

The model was Bettie Page before her career took off to the heights of being labeled &#x201c;The Queen of Pin Ups&#x201d;. Here, for the first time ever, are those photographs from that afternoon session. Outside of a few of the images used as reference for paperback book covers, these pictures have never been seen before. Faragasso would go on to serve as teacher at the prestigious Art Students League of New York and also paint 100&#x2019;s of paperback covers, mostly in the science fiction and gothic romance genres.</p><p>Jack Faragasso is a native born New Yorker who has been teaching drawing, painting, and composition at the Art Students League of New York since 1968. It was only natural that Mr. Faragasso, after being discharged from the US Army, to enroll in an art school. At the Art Students League of New York, he studied with Frank Reilly, both in New York and Woodstock and learned how to paint landscape and the figure outdoors. Reilly also taught photography as it was necessary for executing illustrations for portraits. Reilly was and still is regarded by many as one of the finest teachers of drawing and painting in the country. Faragasso, continues as the foremost authority on the Reilly system of drawing and painting. After his studies with Reilly, Mr. Faragasso embarked on a career of free lancing every type of art work, especially paperback book covers which were a good outlet for realistic representational painting then. In 1967, Mr. Faragasso assumed directorship and instructor of Reilly&#x2019;s School and then in 1968, he brought the students back to the league where he is still teaching and carrying on Reilly&#x2019;s work. Regarding drawing, Mr. Faragasso&#x2019;s class covers a thorough knowledge of light and shade, as well as structure, planes and forms, and how light reveals them.These subjects are drawn with the principles of &#x201c;growth&#x201d; and &#x201c;action,&#x201d; using a varied line to make the drawing more dimensional and expressive. As for the painting of the portrait and the figure, students are taught how to make an imprimatura, an underpainting used from the days of the Renaissance. Classes also cover color and the palette; the mixing of complexion tones for any complexion in any lighting condition, be it indoors or outdoors; the lay-in and massing of tones; edges and brushwork; drapery; and many other subjects concerning painting in oils.</p><h2>The Adventures of Robin Hood (Puffin Pixels)</h2><p><p><b>Embrace your inner geek with Puffin Pixels<br><br>Puffin Pixels&nbsp;</b>is a collection of classics featuring pixelated, 8-bit video game cover artwork in the Minecraft style.&nbsp;<br><br>Robin Hood, champion of the poor and opponent of the Sheriff of Nottingham, takes refuge in the Sherwood Forest and outwits his enemies with daring and panache.</p></p><p>Roger Lancelyn Green (1918-1987) was a biographer of children&#x2019;s writers and a reteller of myths, legends and fairy tales.

Lawrence</h2><p>The exploits of T.E. Lawrence as British liaison officer in the Arab Revolt, recounted in his work Seven Pillars of Wisdom, made him one of the most famous Englishmen of his generation. This biography explores his life and career including his correspondence with writers, artists and politicians.</p><p>Thomas Edward Lawrence's discovery that he was an illegitimate child filled him with deep bitterness and insecurity. As "Lawrence of Arabia," he struggled to achieve a sense of identity and personal worth missing in his boyhood. His homosexual rape by Turkish captors in 1917 scarred him with guilt and shame, making the prospect of consummation in a marriage abhorrent, contends Wilson, official biographer as authorized by the Lawrence estate, who rebuts claims that his subject had homosexual affairs. According to this 1200-page tome, Lawrence was not the benevolent imperialist some critics have made him out to be, but an ardent supporter of Arab self-determination who felt morally degraded by the compromising role the British forced him to play in the Arab revolt against Turkish rule. This sense of debasement, argues Wison, engendered a masochistic disorder that later led Lawrence to enlist in the Royal Air Force. Through its comprehensive amassing of facts and documents, the book credibly replaces the romantic legend of Lawrence with the image of a tragic idealist whose political aims were frustrated by diplomacy. Photos. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Numerous books have been written about T.E. Lawrence since his death in 1935, particularly in the last decade. This volume is fuller and more balanced than its predecessors, drawing extensively on relevant documents, including recently released British government records and never before available Lawrence family papers. Wilson successfully depicts all aspects of Lawrence's strengths and accomplishments, including his development as a literary figure and his friendships with writers and political leaders, without either minimizing or overdramatizing his psychological and emotional weaknesses. Wilson's lucid and well-paced prose style makes his careful research fascinating. This detailed study may be too elaborate for the casual reader, but it will be essential for libraries with readers seriously interested in the period or the man.<br><i>- Elizabeth R. Hayford, Assoc.

But with the fall of the Twin Towers came a turning point in his life. After graduating he joined the Central Intelligence Agency, determined to get himself to Afghanistan and into the center of the action. Through persistence and hard work he was fast-tracked to a clandestine operations position overseas. Dropped into a remote region of Afghanistan, he received his baptism by fire. Frustrated by bureaucratic red tape, a widespread lack of knowledge of the local customs and culture and an attitude of complacency that hindered his ability to combat the local Taliban, Doug confounded his peers by dressing like a native and mastering the local dialect, making contact and building sources within several deadly terrorist networks. His new approach resulted in unprecedented successes, including uncovering the largest IED network in the world, responsible for killing hundreds of US soldiers. Meanwhile, Doug had to keep up false pretenses with his family, girlfriend and friends--nobody could know what he did for a living--and deal with the emotional turbulence of constantly living a lie. His double life was building to an explosive resolution, with repercussions that would have far reaching consequences.</p></p><p><p>DOUGLAS LAUX is a former CIA operations officer who served multiple tours throughout the Middle East.

He did not play again for six months; then when he did, he carded a seventy-seven. Vexed, he grew increasingly obsessed and devoted over the next thirty years to solving the science behind the perfect golf swing, self-publishing his findings in 1969 in a book titled <i>The Golfing Machine</i>. This revolutionary book <i>explained</i> golf, unlike every other tome that merely <i>described</i> it. Unfortunately, the majority of golfers dismissed the book because it was all but unreadable, too thick with physics and geometry and scientific vernacular. <i>The Golfing Machine</i> seemed doomed to obscurity until visionary teacher Ben Doyle and superstar-in-the-making Bobby Clampett brought Kelley's teachings to prominence-only to witness Clampett implode on golf's most public stage. Validation finally came seventy years after Homer Kelley's lifework began, and twenty-five years after his death, when a teenage prodigy named Morgan Pressel became the youngest golfer, male or female, ever to win a major championship.<br><br> In <i>Homer Kelley's Golfing Machine</i>, veteran journalist Scott Gummer brings to light the untold story of golf's most curious genius. A colorful portrait of obsession and an enlightening look into the nuances of the game, Kelley's amazing journey illuminates an important but underappreciated chapter in the history of golf.</p><p>Ever since Homer Kelley first published <i>The Golfing Machine </i>in 1969, people have been clamoring for a book that explains his theories in easier-to-understand terms.

Narrator Lucy West is married to Max and is the mother of 14-year-old Margaret and first-grader Jeremy. The Wests live in a small town, where Max is editor of the local newspaper, and life has mostly been good, but as Lucy begins her story, in June 1998, shes suffering from panic attacks. Shes been offered a job with a prestigious ad agency in nearby Boston, and she fears that Max, who himself suffers from depression, might not be able to cope if she works full-time. As the summer progresses, Lucy finds she has to deal with even more disturbing problems, these detailed in chapters alternating with her recollections of the recent past. Lucy and Max are close friends with Kate and Chip Cunningham, parents of Matthew and Abby. The two women share confidences, their children are pals, the couples socialize and vacation together on Nantucket. As in all friendships, though, there are the inevitable moments of envy and competition. Lucys memories of the early years of the West/Cunningham bond reveal one especially fraught period. Lucy had a stillborn baby, and grieving Max ignored his wife, who found it hard to be friends with Kate when she gave birth to Abby shortly thereafter. A brief affair with Chip revitalized Lucy and her marriage; soon after, she was pregnant with Jeremy. But when Jeremy is diagnosed in August 1998 with cystic fibrosis, a genetically caused disease, and the doctor suggests Max be tested, Lucy has to admit that Chip could also be the father. Will her confession end not just her friendship with Kate but her marriage? Can love and loyalty endure . . . even barely? Plot-driven, yes, but theres more than enough compensation in Thayer's insights into the tangled webs woven by friendship. (Literary Guild alternate selection) -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Two Massachusetts families live out a decade of births, deaths, secrets and infidelities in this moving 12th novel from Thayer (An Act of Love). Narrator Lucy West, 37, is a self-employed mother of two; her husband, Max, edits the local newspaper in Sussex, a Boston suburb. Suave, irreverent Kate Cunningham and her husband, Chip, an attorney, move to Sussex in 1987; Kate and Lucy meet at their children's preschool and become fast friends. Soon the couples summer together on Nantucket, and their lives grow ever more entwined. Thayer's narrative jumps back and forth between the couples' present and their shared past. One set of chapters follows the Wests and the Cunninghams from 1987 to 1991: during these years, Kate chafed in her unfulfilling marriage, Max becomes a depressed workaholic and Lucy, devastated by her stillborn baby, takes comfort in a brief affair with Chip. Other chapters relate the events of 1998, which test Lucy's marriage and friendship all over again. When her son, Jeremy (conceived in 1991), is diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, both couples must confront the chance that Chip, not Max, is Jeremy's real father. Readers prepared for the slow pace of Thayer's plot will appreciate her detailed, realistic records of motherhood, child-rearing and domestic routine in Sussex and Nantucket. The finale, set in Boston's Children's Hospital, will strike some as cathartic and fulfilling, others as pat and predictable. Yet thoughtful chronicles of female friendship (see The Book Borrower, above) always have appeal, and Thayer's twist on the relationship is sure and steady.

Reissue.</p><p><p>Ian Fleming (1908-1964), creator of the world's best-known secret agent, is the author of fourteen James Bond books. Born in London in 1908 and educated at Eton and Sandhurst, he became the Reuters Moscow correspondent in 1929. In the spring of 1939, Fleming went back to Moscow as a special correspondent for the <b>London Times</b>. In June of that same year, he joined Naval Intelligence and served throughout World War II, finally earning the rank of Commander, RNVSR (Sp.). Much of the James Bond material was drawn directly from Fleming's experiences as an intelligence officer. Later, Fleming became a consultant on foreign affairs for the <b>London Sunday Times</b>, by which time he had become far better known as the creator of James Bond.</p>'You know what?' said Major Dexter Smythe to the octopus. 'You're going to have a real treat today if I can manage it.' <p>He had spoken aloud and his breath had steamed up the glass of his Pirelli mask. He put his feet down to the sand and stood up. The water reached to his armpits. He took off the mask and spat into it, rubbed the spit round the glass, rinsed it clean and pulled the rubber band of the mask back over his head. He bent down again.</p> <p>The eye in the mottled brown sack was still watching him carefully from the hole in the coral, but now the tip of a single small tentacle wavered hesitatingly an inch or two out of the shadows and quested vaguely with its pink suckers uppermost. Dexter Smythe smiled with satisfaction. Given time, perhaps one more month on top of the two during which he had been chumming up with the octopus, and he would have tamed the darling. But he wasn't going to have that month. Should he take a chance today and reach down and offer his hand, instead of the expected lump of raw meat on the end of his spear, to the tentacle - shake it by the hand, so to speak? No, Pussy, he thought. I can't quite trust you yet. Almost certainly other tentacles would whip out of the hole and up his arm. He only needed to be dragged down less than two feet, the cork valve on his mask would automatically close and he would be suffocated inside it or, if he tore it off, drowned. He might get in a quick lucky jab with his spear, but it would take more than that to kill Pussy. No. Perhaps later in the day. It would be rather like playing Russian roulette, and at about the same five-to-one-odds. It might be a quick, a whimsical way out of his troubles! But not now. It would leave the interesting question unsolved. And he had promised that nice Professor Bengry at the Institute. Dexter Smythe swam leisurely off towards the reef, his eyes questing for one shape only, the squat sinister wedge of a scorpion fish, or, as Bengry would put it, Scorpaena Plumieri.</p> <p>Major Dexter Smythe, OBE, Royal Marines (Retd), was the remains of a once brave and resourceful officer and of a handsome man who had made easy sexual conquests all his military life and particularly among the Wrens and Wracs and ATS who manned the com-munications and secretariat of the very special task force to which he had been attached at the end of his service career. Now he was fifty-four, slightly bald and his belly sagged in the Jantzen trunks. And he had had two coronary thromboses. His doctor, Jimmy Greaves (who had been one of their high poker game at Queen's Club when Dexter Smythe had first come to Jamaica), had half-jocularly described the later one, only a month before, as 'the second warning'. But, in his well-chosen clothes, his varicose veins out of sight and his stomach flattened by a discreet support belt behind an immaculate cummerbund, he was still a fine figure of a man at a cocktail party or dinner on the North Shore, and it was a mystery to his friends and neighbours why, in defiance of the two ounces of whisky and ten cigarettes a day to which his doctor had rationed him, he persisted in smoking like a chimney and going to bed drunk, if amiably drunk, every night.</p> <p>The truth of the matter was that Dexter Smythe had arrived at the frontier of the death-wish. The origins of this state of mind were many and not all that complex. He was irretrievably tied to Jamaica, and tropical sloth had gradually riddled him so that while outwardly he appeared a piece of fairly solid hardwood, under the varnished surface the termites of sloth, self-indulgence, guilt over an ancient sin and general disgust with himself had eroded his once hard core into dust. Since the death of Mary two years before, he had loved no one. He wasn't even sure that he had really loved her, but he knew that, every hour of the day, he missed her love of him and her gay, untidy, chiding and often irritating presence, and though he ate their canapes and drank their martinis, he had nothing but contempt for the international riff-raff with whom he consorted on the North Shore. He could perhaps have made friends with the soldier elements, the gentleman-farmers inland, or the plantation owners on the coast, the professional men and the politicians, but that would mean regaining some serious purpose in life which his sloth, his spiritual accidie, prevented, and cutting down on the bottle, which he was definitely unwilling to do. So Major Smythe was bored, bored to death, and, but for one factor in his life, he would long ago have swallowed the bottle of barbiturates he had easily acquired from a local doctor. The lifeline that kept him clinging to the edge of the cliff was a tenuous one. Heavy drinkers veer towards an exaggeration of their basic temperaments, the classic four - Sanguine, Phlegmatic, Choleric and Melancholic. The Sanguine drunk goes gay to the point of hysteria and idiocy. The Phlegmatic sinks into a morass of sullen gloom. The Choleric is the fighting drunk of the cartoonists who spends much of his life in prison for smashing people and things, and the Melancholic succumbs to self-pity, mawkishness and tears. Major Smythe was a Melancholic who had slid into a drooling fantasy woven around the birds and insects and fish that inhabited the five acres of Wavelets (the name he had given his small villa is symptomatic), its beach and the coral reef beyond. The fish were his particular favourites. He referred to them as 'people' and, since reef fish stick to their territories as closely as do most small birds, after two years he knew them all intimately, 'loved' them and believed that they loved him in return.</p> <p>They certainly knew him, as the denizens of zoos know their keepers, because he was a daily and a regular provider, scraping off algae and stirring up the sand and rocks for the bottom-feeders, breaking up sea eggs and urchins for the small carnivores and bringing out scraps of offal for the larger ones, and now, as he swam slowly and heavily up and down the reef and through the channels that led out to deep water, his 'people' swarmed around him fearlessly and expectantly, darting at the tip of the three-pronged spear they knew only as a prodigal spoon, flirting right up to the glass of the Pirelli and even, in the case of the fearless, pugnacious demoiselles, nipping softly at his feet and legs. Part of Major Smythe's mind took in all these brilliantly coloured little 'people', but today he had a job to do and while he greeted them in unspoken words - 'Morning, Beau Gregory' to the dark-blue demoiselle sprinkled with bright-blue spots, the 'jewel fish' that exactly resembles the starlit fashioning of a bottle of Worth's 'Vol de Nuit'; 'Sorry. Not today, sweetheart,' to a fluttering butterfly fish with false black 'eyes' on its tail and, 'You're too fat anyway, Blue Boy,' to an indigo parrot fish that must have weighed a good ten pounds - his eyes were searching for only one of his 'people' - his only enemy on the reef, the only one he killed on sight, a scorpion fish.</p> <p>Scorpion fish inhabit most of the southern waters of the world, and the 'rascasse' that is the foundation of bouillabaisse belongs to the family. The West Indian variety runs up to only about twelve inches long and perhaps a pound in weight. It is by far the ugliest fish in the sea, as if nature were giving warning. It is a mottled brownish grey with a heavy, wedge-shaped shaggy head. It has fleshy pendulous 'eyebrows' that droop over angry red eyes and a coloration and broken silhouette that are perfect camouflage on the reef. Though a small fish, its heavily toothed mouth is so wide that it can swallow whole most of the smaller reef fishes, but its supreme weapon lies in its erectile dorsal fins, the first few of which, acting on contact like hypodermic needles, are fed by poison glands containing enough tetrodotoxin to kill a man if they merely graze him in a vulnerable spot - in an artery, for instance, or over the heart or in the groin. They constitute the only real danger to the reef swimmer, far more dangerous than barracuda or shark, because, supremely confident in their camouflage and armoury, they flee before nothing except the very close approach of a foot or actual contact. Then they flit only a few yards on wide and bizarrely striped pectorals and settle again watchfully either on the sand, where they look like a lump of overgrown coral, or amongst the rocks and seaweed, where they virtually disappear. And Major Smythe was determined to find one, spear it and give it to his octopus to see if it would take or spurn it, see if one of the ocean's great predators would recognize the deadliness of another, know of its poison. Would the octopus consume the belly and leave the spines? Would it eat the lot and, if so, would it suffer from the poison? These were the questions Bengry at the Institute wanted answered and today, since it was going to be the beginning of the end of Major Smythe's life at Wavelets and though it might mean the end of his darling Octopussy, Major Smythe had decided to find out the answers and leave one tiny memorial to his now futile life in some dusty corner of the Institute's marine biological files.</p> <p>For, only a couple of hours earlier, Major Dexter Smythe's already dismal life had changed very much for the worse. So much for the worse that he would be lucky if, in a few weeks' time - time for the sending of cables from Government House to the Colonial Office, to be relayed to the Secret Service and thence to Scotland Yard and the Public Prosecutor, and for Major Smythe's transportation to London with a police escort - he got away with a sentence of imprisonment for life.</p> <p>And all this because of a man called Bond, Commander James Bond, who had turned up at ten thirty that morning in a taxi from Kingston.</p> <p>The day had started normally. Major Smythe had awoken from his Seconal sleep, swallowed a couple of Panadols (his heart condition forbade him aspirin), showered and skimped his breakfast under the umbrella-shaped sea-almonds and spent an hour feeding the remains of his breakfast to the birds. He then took his prescribed doses of anti-coagulant and blood-pressure pills and killed time with the Daily Gleaner until he could have his elevenses which, for months now, he had advanced to ten thirty. He had just poured himself the first of two stiff brandies and ginger ales, 'the drunkard's drink', when he heard the car coming up the drive.</p> <p>Luna, his coloured housekeeper, came out into the garden and announced, 'Gemmun to see you, Major.'</p> <p>'What's his name?'</p> <p>'Him doan say. Major. Him say to tell you him come from Govment House.'</p> <p>Major Smythe was wearing nothing but a pair of old khaki shorts and sandals. He said, 'All right, Luna. Put him in the living room and say I won't be a moment,' and went round the back way into his bedroom and put on a white bush shirt and trousers and brushed his hair. Government House! Now what the hell?</p> <p>As soon as he had walked through into the living-room and seen the tall man in the dark-blue tropical suit standing at the picture window looking out to sea, Major Smythe had somehow sensed bad news. Then, when the man had turned slowly to look at him with watchful, serious blue-grey eyes, he had known that this was officialdom, and when his cheery smile was not returned, inimical officialdom. A chill had run down Major Smythe's spine. 'They' had somehow found out.</p> <p>'Well, well. I'm Smythe. I gather you're from Government House. How's Sir Kenneth?'</p> <p>There was somehow no question of shaking hands. The man said, 'I haven't met him. I only arrived a couple of days ago. I've been out round the island most of the time. My name's Bond, James Bond. I'm from the Ministry of Defence.'</p> <p>Major Smythe remembered the hoary euphemism for the Secret Service. He said, with forced cheerfulness, 'Oh. The old firm?'</p> <p>The question had been ignored. 'Is there somewhere we can talk?'</p> <p>'Rather. Anywhere you like. Here or in the garden? What about a drink?' Major Smythe clinked the ice in the glass he still held in his hand.' Rum and ginger's the local poison. I prefer the ginger by itself. 'The lie came out with the automatic smoothness of the alcoholic.</p> <p>' No thanks. And here would be fine.' The man leaned 5negligently against the wide mahogany windowsill.</p> <p>Major Smythe sat down and threw a jaunty leg over the low arm of one of the comfortable planters' chairs he had had copied from an original by the local cabinet-maker. He pulled out the drink coaster from the other 1arm, took a deep pull at his glass and slid it, with a consciously steady hand, down into the hole in the wood. 'Well,' he said cheerily, looking the other man straight in the eyes,'what can I do for you? Somebody been up to some dirty work on the North Shore and you need a spare hand? Be glad to get into harness again. It's been a long time since those days, but I can still remember some of the old routines.'</p> <p>'Do you mind if I smoke?' The man had already got his cigarette case in his hand. It was a flat gun-metal one that would hold a round fifty. Somehow this small sign of a shared weakness comforted Major Smythe.</p> <p>'Of course, my dear fellow.' He made a move to get up, his lighter ready. 'It's all right, thanks.' James Bond had already lit his cigarette. 'No, it's nothing local. I want to, I've been sent out to ask you to recall your work for the Service at the end of the war.' James Bond paused and looked down at Major Smythe carefully. 'Particularly the time when you were working with the Miscellaneous Objectives Bureau.'</p> <p>Major Smythe laughed sharply. He had known it. He had known it for absolutely sure. But when it came out of this man's mouth, the laugh had been forced out of Major Smythe like the scream of a hit man. 'Oh Lord, yes. Good old MOB. That was a lark all right.' He laughed again. He felt the anginal pain, brought on by the pressure of what he knew was coming, build up across his chest. He dipped his hand into his trouser pocket, tilted the little bottle into the palm of his hand and slipped the white TNT pill under his tongue. He was amused to see the tension coil up in the other man, the way the eyes narrowed watchfully. It's all right, my dear fellow. This isn't a death pill. He said, 'You troubled with acidosis? No? It slays me when I go on a bender. Last night. Party at Jamaica Inn. One really ought to stop thinking one's always twenty-five. Anyway, let's get back to MOB Force. Not many of us left, I suppose.' He felt the pain across his chest withdraw into its lair. 'Something to do with the Official History?'</p> <p>James Bond looked down at the tip of his cigarette. 'Not exactly.'</p> <p>'I expect you know I wrote most of the chapter on the Force for the War Book. It's a long time ago now. Doubt if I'd have much to add today.'</p> <p>'Nothing more about that operation in the Tyrol - place called Ober Aurach, about a mile east of Kitzbuhel?'</p> <p>One of the names he had been living with for all these years forced another harsh laugh out of Major Smythe. 'That was a piece of cake! You've never seen such a shambles. All those Gestapo toughs with their doxies. All of 'em hog-drunk. They'd kept their files all tickety-boo. Handed them over without a murmur. Hoped that'd earn 'em easy treatment, I suppose. We gave the stuff a first going-over and shipped all the bods off to the Munich camp. Last I heard of them. Most of them hanged for war crimes, I expect. We handed the bumph over to HO. at Salzburg. Then we went on up the Mittersill valley after another hideout.' Major Smythe took a good pull at his drink and lit a cigarette. He looked up. 'That's the long and the short of it.'</p> <p>'You were Number 2 at the time, I think.

A penniless orphan, Rob was blessed with a gift that, in the days of witchcraft, could send a man to the stake: he had the ability to sense the chill hand of death when it settled on the living. His skill quickened with the potency of knowledge, and he knew he was born to heal and to be a physician. His quest would take him from the rough roads of Britain to the sumptuous and corrupt courts of Persia and the school of the greatest healer of his time. Disguised as a Jew, toiling as a war surgeon in the conflicts of Eastern empires, he would be helped by mighty patrons and threatened by plague and the cruel prejudice of mullahs and clerics.

She received a bachelor&#39;s degree from Brown University and a master&#39;s degree from Oxford University. She currently works as an editor and lives in Brooklyn, New York.Dark and riveting, Morgan&#x2019;s entry in the very popular dystopian, postapocalyptic YA subgenre blends science fiction, romance, and characters&#x2019; shadow sides with a mostly engrossing plotline. In a future lived on spaceships, long after the earth&#x2019;s destruction, teenage delinquents are usually sentenced to die for their transgressions. Then 100 of them, who are deemed disposable guinea pigs, are instead sent to the ravaged earth in order to see if it is habitable for humans. Clarke, Wells, Bellamy, and Glass are the four narrators, through whose voices the story line sometimes glides and sometimes bumps along. The differing perspectives shed much light on the otherwise lightly drawn world setting, but it can sometimes be hard to leave one character for the next. Regardless, Morgan&#x2019;s debut clips along at an easy pace because of its simple yet direct writing style. A mash-up of The Lord of the Flies, Across the Universe, and The Hunger Games this has already been tapped by the CW network for television production. It should appeal to fans of postapocalyptic novels seeking the next potentially big new thing. Grades 9-12. --Julie Trevelyan</p><h2>The Oxford Book of Humorous Prose: From William Caxton to P.G. Wodehouse</h2><p>If puritanism is, as H.L. Mencken once said, the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy, then this glorious, monumental collection by one of England's most popular humorists is a puritan's nightmare. Focusing primarily on the 19th and 20th century, but with material dating back to Columbus, Frank Muir has packed this volume with enough joy and laughter to sink the Mayflower. <br> The range of comic material is amazing--from the gentle, charming comedy of manners, to biting satire, to outrageous parody. There are excerpts from the novels of Jane Austen and P.G. Wodehouse and Mark Twain, complete short stories by O. Henry and Frank O'Connor, classic tall tales from Australia (including one by "Banjo" Patterson, who also wrote "Waltzing Matilda"), passages from Groucho Marx's correspondence with Warner Brothers, newspaper columns written by Art Buchwald and Myles na Gopaleen (the novelist Flann O'Brien), a selection of Samuel Johnson's comic definitions, plus a sprinkling of egregious puns, witty sayings, and even the clever names of stores (such as the New York restaurant "Just for the Halibut" and the London beauty parlor "Curl Up and Dye"). Muir has gathered work from over two hundred writers and from every English-speaking country. Virtually all of your favorites are here: Jonathan Swift, Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Laurence Sterne, Anita Loos, Ring Lardner, Alexander Woollcott, Robert Benchley, Dorothy Parker, S.J. Perelman, Damon Runyon, Fran Lebowitz, Joseph Heller, Evelyn Waugh, Garrison Keilor, Erma Bombeck, Tom Wolfe, and countless others. In addition, there are comic pieces from writers you wouldn't expect to find--such as Thomas Hardy or Lawrence Durrell--and many many writers you may not have discovered yet, such as Jerome K. Jerome or Daisy Ashford (who wrote an unintentionally hysterical novel at age nine, which she published in her thirties). <br> Frank Muir is one of Britain's best-loved humorists, the host of a highly popular television show and the prolific author of dozens of hilarious books, including the best-selling <em>The Frank Muir Book</em>. Here he provides not only a painfully funny collection, but also generous introductions to each writer, which are comic gems in themselves. Except for the occasional puritan, this is a book that everyone will enjoy.</p><p><br><em>About the Editor:</em><br><strong>Frank Muir</strong> is a well-known British TV personality and author of the best-selling <em>The Frank Muir Book</em>.<br>The last piece of subtitle data tells what this hefty book is all about. It is neither a reference book of the "treasury" or "thesaurus" type nor a true anthology. It is, rather, a leisurely stroll through various humorists of various nationalities writing in English: the standard (Dickens, Twain), the expected (Dorothy Parker, Benchley, Shaw), the unexpected (Walter Scott!; George Eliot!), the well-known (Waugh, Leacock, Amis), the unknown (Johnson I. Hooper?; Barry Crump?), the classic (Sterne, Samuel Johnson), and the modern (Erma Bombeck, Garrison Keillor). Selections are generally very short, with bridges, often fairly humorous of themselves, by Muir. The humor ranges from the broad to the subtle and, in fact, in any other way that humor might range; there's something in here for everyone. Buy for browsers.<br><i>- Robert E. Brown, Onondaga Cty.

Once a small, Southern California animation house, it has grown into an entertainment conglomerate encompassing movies, television, music, video games, and a sprawling theme park. <br><br>When an actor portraying Familyland&#x2019;s beloved mascot, Rambunctious Rabbit, is brutally murdered on park grounds, Lamaar executives are worried that the idyllic image of &#x2018;50s America represented in Familyland will be shattered. They ask Mike Lomax and his partner Terry Biggs, the LAPD detectives assigned to solve the case, to keep the circumstances surrounding the death of their mascot quiet.<br><br>When a second Lamaar employee is killed, Lomax and Biggs uncover a conspiracy to destroy Familyland and settle an unknown vendetta. Still under pressure to keep the case away from the public eye, the detectives are met with a third murder &#x2013; and an outrageous demand: Anyone who associates with Lamaar &#x2013; employees, customers, anyone &#x2013; will be killed. <br><br>Bringing a fresh duo of cops to the thriller set, <b>The Rabbit Factory </b>is both suspenseful and satiric, a taut mystery wrapped in sharp, comedic prose.</p><p>About 30 pages into <i>The Rabbit Factory</i> you will find yourself hoping that the book's author Marshall Karp is at home typing. He has created two LAPD cops, Mike Lomax and his partner Terry Biggs, who are smart, drop-dead funny (especially Terry), and as irreverent as two guys can be. Karp has also written a ripping good story, not counting on buddy-cop banter to carry the day. <p> Mike Lomax's wife, Joanie, died of cancer six months before the action begins, after a long time trying to have a family. Instead of leaving little replicas of herself, she leaves letters, which Mike opens on the 18th of every month, the anniversary of her death. His father, Big Jim, loved Joanie very much but wants to see Mike get on with his life. These guys love each other a lot and the dialogue that Karp gives them is both sharp and tender. Terry Biggs met his wife, Marilyn, who was the paramedic called when he was an "Officer Down." That meeting is so funny you have to read it to believe it. </p><p> </p><blockquote>One thing, as they say, led to another, and despite the fact that Marilyn had seven-year-old twin daughters, and a third, age five, Terry signed on for the whole package. And that's how a guy from the Bronx winds up living in Sherman Oaks with a wife and three teenage Valley girls.</blockquote> <p> The setting of much of the action is "Familyland," a Disneyland clone, conceived of by the late Dean Lamaar, who, like Disney, started out as an animator. His creations, Rambunctious Rabbit, Slaphappy Puppy, McGreedy the Moose, and others are now big family favorites and the little cartoon studio is a global conglomerate. It has been recently sold to the Japanese, after faltering receipts, and there are plans afoot to open a theme park in Las Vegas. That opening is just months away when an employee playing Rambunctious Rabbit is murdered on the premises. Not good for the corporate image. Another murder takes place, and another, and it quickly becomes obvious that someone has it in for Lamaar's enterprises. Mike and Terry are under tremendous pressure from Ike Rose, CEO of Lamaar, to keep the whole mess under wraps, and an equal amount of pressure from their Chief to "get it solved." They work smart and long and hard to uncover a conspiracy, finding a big surprise at the end of the search. </p><p> Marshall Karp is a refreshing addition to the suspense, satire, mystery genre. His two Detectives are irresistible. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>"Marshall Karp could well be the Carl Hiaasen of Los Angeles &#x2013; only I think he&#x2019;s even funnier.

Raskin, working with children's writer/editor Debora Pearson, chronicles a remarkable trip to "mysterious" Timbuktu -- and then "beyond the beyond," to the distant mines of Taoudeni, one of the most remote locations on Earth. On his travels, Raskin confronts danger and harsh elements, but is able to thoroughly immerse himself in the ancient and fascinating traditions of desert culture. </p><p> The journal-style text and lavish photographs invite the reader to partake in his adventures and splendid discoveries. Raskin, infused with enthusiasm and great wit, chronicles what it's like to travel over seas of orange sand, spend nights looking for "lighthouses" in the desert, experience the remarkable smell of camel's breath, toil in a salt pit, explore nomad camps and desert cities, and much more. Each chapter features a map tracking the progress of his travels, as well as informative sidebars. </p></p><p><p> <b>Lawrie Raskin</b> has always been enthralled with the Sahara Desert. He has lived with desert nomads and traveled with them on their camel caravans. As a result of his many trips to North Africa and the Middle East, he became fluent in Arabic, filmed TV documentaries, worked as an expedition guide and sold his photographs to various media around the globe. </p><p> As a youngster, Raskin was deeply affected by children's books about nomadic life and the desert. In his teens, his imagination was further stirred by seeing the epic film <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>. On numerous occasions in the thirty-odd years that followed, he visited, explored and lived in desert regions from the Sahara to Afghanistan. These journeys included several lengthy adventures on camelback, learning the ways and dialects of the desert peoples, with the dream of someday reaching the legendary caravan city of Timbuktu. </p><p> Raskin has lived many adventures in Toronto, London, Fez, Marrakesh, Cairo, Jackson's Point and Tichitt (Mauritania), before moving to Kingston, Ontario. He studied with the Faculty of Architecture in Toronto, and held previous positions as architect, graphic designer, interior designer, photographer and expedition organizer/leader. Raskin now works as a design consultant and photographer in Kingston, Ontario, where he maintains a collection of over 400 camels. </p><p><b>Excerpt</b></p> <p><b>How I Became a Desert Explorer</b></p> <p>Ever since I was a kid growing up in Toronto, I wanted to see the desert. I'm an adult now, but I can still remember the first time I thought about taking a desert adventure. I had read a comic book in which Donald Duck and his nephews went to the Sahara, rode camels over sand dunes, and visited an oasis. I was so fascinated with this story that I read that comic over and over until it fell apart!</p> <p>Later on, when I was a teenager, I saw a movie that made me want to go to the desert even more. The movie was <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>, and I couldn't get enough of the scenes that were shot in the actual desert. I saw <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i> again and again, and it had the same effect on me as reading the comic book had years before, only stronger. I absolutely <i>had</i> to see a desert for myself. And so, several years later, I traveled to Africa to see the Sahara, the world's largest desert. </p> <p>Some people who go to a place for the first time have a feeling that they've been there before. For me, that place is the Sahara. On my first trip there I felt like I belonged, almost like I had returned to my real home. I wanted to explore everything there, from the things that seemed strangely familiar to the things that seemed just plain strange.</p> <p>Since my first trip there, I've explored the Sahara many more times. Going "home" all those times has changed my life and turned me into a desert expert. I've learned how to speak Arabic, lived with desert peoples, and organized many expeditions through the Sahara. I've discovered lots about life in the desert, but there will always be much more for me to learn -- that's why I'll keep going back as often as I can. On each trip, I get excited all over again!</p> <p>Exploring the desert has been -- and is -- the best adventure of my life. I hope that as you take this trip with me you'll feel some of the excitement I've felt. And who knows? Perhaps you'll start to think about some great adventures you can take, too!</p> <p><i>Lawrie Raskin</i></p></p><h2>Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits - India Edition</h2><p>New book, limited stock,for prompt shipping choose expedite shipping, standard shipping 18-20 days, shippment from india</p><p></p><h2>Kokkari: Contemporary Greek Flavors</h2><p>Hardcover with color photos</p><p></p><h2>The old man and the afternoon cat</h2><p>An orange and white striped cat causes a notorious grump to change his ways.</p><p></p><h2>Us Against You: A Novel (Beartown)</h2><p><b>The #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>A Man Called Ove</i> and <i>Beartown</i> returns with an unforgettable novel &#x201c;about people&#x2014;about strength and tribal loyalty and what we unwittingly do when trying to show our boys how to be men&#x201d; (Jojo Moyes).</b><br><br><i>Have you ever seen a town fall?

No matter how difficult times get, they&#x2019;ve always been able to take pride in their local ice hockey team. So it&#x2019;s a cruel blow when they hear that Beartown ice hockey might soon be disbanded. What makes it worse is the obvious satisfaction that all the former Beartown players, who now play for a rival team in the neighboring town of Hed, take in that fact. As the tension mounts between the two adversaries, a newcomer arrives who gives Beartown hockey a surprising new coach and a chance at a comeback.<br> <br>Soon a team starts to take shape around Amat, the fastest player you&#x2019;ll ever see; Benji, the intense lone wolf; always dutiful and eager-to-please Bobo; and Vidar, a born-to-be-bad troublemaker. But bringing this team together proves to be a challenge as old bonds are broken, new ones are formed, and the town&#x2019;s enmity with Hed grows more and more acute.<br> <br>As the big game approaches, the not-so-innocent pranks and incidents between the communities pile up and their mutual contempt intensifies. By the time the last goal is scored, a resident of Beartown will be dead, and the people of both towns will be forced to wonder if, after everything, the game they love can ever return to something as simple and innocent as a field of ice, two nets, and two teams.

Griffin is the author of six bestselling series.<p><b>I<br> [ONE]<br> 7522 Battersby Street, Philadelphia<br> Wednesday, September 9, 1:55 A.M. </b> </p> <p>Tony Harris returned to his bed, silently cursing himself for not having hit the john before he&#x2019;d crawled under the sheets two hours earlier. Harris&#x2014;a thirtyeight- year-old homicide detective in the Philadelphia Police Department who was slight of build and starting to bald&#x2014;then clicked off the lamp on his bedside table. As he put his head on his pillow and sighed, wondering when&#x2014;or even if&#x2014;he&#x2019;d start to drift off back to sleep, a monstrous <i>BOOM </i> shook the house. It reverberated through the darkened room, knocking loose a picture frame from the wall, its glass breaking when it hit the floor. </p> <p>&#x201c;Holy shit!&#x201d; he said aloud, sitting bolt upright and clicking on the lamp. He looked toward the front window. </p> <p><i>What in hell was that? </i> </p> <p><i>Did a damn gas leak just blow up the middle school? </i> </p> <p>Austin Meehan Middle School was a half-block down the tree-lined residential street. </p> <p>Harris quickly got out of bed, crossed the room, and pulled back the curtain to look out the window. On either side of Battersby, the Northeast Philadelphia neighborhood had a series of nearly identical, neatly kept comfortable two-story brick duplexes with large lawns. The homes&#x2014;some of which now with their lights flicking on&#x2014;had stone fa�ades on the front and garages in the rear, on a common alleyway. Because Harris&#x2019;s garage served more as a storage unit than a car park, he left his city-issued Ford Crown Victoria sitting at the curb in front of his house. </p> <p>It took Harris no time to locate the direction of the source: In the sky some blocks to the east, he saw a bright glow that he recognized as that from an intense fire. </p> <p><i>Maybe a gas station on Frankford went up? </i> he wondered as he automatically started picking up his clothes from the chair where he&#x2019;d tossed them at midnight. He quickly pulled on his wrinkled pants and short-sleeved knit shirt, then slipped on socks and shoes. He watched as the glow from the fire seemed to pulse even brighter, as if the fire were being fed more fuel. &#x201c;Jesus!&#x201d; he said aloud. </p> <p>Harris double-checked that he had his wallet and badge and pistol, then ran down the stairs as fast as he dared and out the door. </p> <p>He drove the Crown Vic up Battersby, turning right onto Ryan Avenue, then followed it the seven blocks to Frankford Avenue, where Harris could clearly see that the intense glow was to the south. He was about to make the turn when he heard the wail of sirens&#x2014;and then the huge horns blaring&#x2014;of two fire department emergency medical vehicles. The red-and-white ambulances flew up on the intersection, braked heavily as they lay steadily on their horns, then accelerated through it. </p> <p>Harris checked for any other vehicles headed for the intersection. He saw that it was clear and turned to follow the ambulances. </p> <p>As he went south on Frankford, the sky became a brighter orange-red mingled with black and gray smoke. And then, down on the left side of the street, he saw the first of the flames. They were coming from the back of the Philly Inn, an aging two-story motel that had been built long before Anthony J. Harris had been born at Saint Joseph&#x2019;s Hospital. </p> <p>He pulled into a parking lot to the north of the motel, to where he had a better view of all the activity. He also enjoyed more than a little of an olfactory assault from the awful smell filling the air and now entering the car via the dash vents. </p> <p><i>That&#x2019;s the smell of burning wood, for sure, and plastics. But I&#x2019;d bet that&#x2019;s also a bit of human flesh . . . you can damn near taste it. </i> </p> <p>Philadelphia Fire Department Engine 36, from the station just up Frankford, already was on the scene. It had hoses snaking everywhere and the firefighters were laying down an impressive amount of water. Other firemen were going door to door, methodically clearing the motel&#x2019;s rooms and herding what people they found inside to a parking lot to the south. Doors that no one answered were busted open with twenty-eight-pound metal battering rams and the hammer-headed pry bars called Halligans. </p> <p>The pair of ambulances that had flown past Harris at the intersection were parked close by, their paramedics pulling out equipment&#x2014;first-aid kits, backboards&#x2014;with a well-practiced efficiency. A minute or so later, Engine 38 came roaring in from its station a mile away on Old State Road&#x2014;followed by an articulated ladder fire truck, which Harris thought a bit of overkill for a lowly two-story structure. </p> <i><p>But, hell. Can&#x2019;t blame them. </p> <p>Everyone loves a little adrenaline rush, especially these guys getting to play with all their toys. </p> <p>And this damn fire seems to offer plenty of excitement. </p> <p>It&#x2019;s got my pulse beating. No way I could go back to sleep now. </p> </i> <p>Harris noted that the Philadelphia Police Department was well represented, too. Cruisers practically surrounded the place. There was even a flatbed wrecker from the Tow Squad, which was being waved toward the back of the motel. Harris looked to where the wrecker was being routed and saw a half-dozen firefighters working feverishly at an SUV. It was on the backside of the motel, at a room with its door blown outward, where the flames appeared to be the hottest. </p> <p><i>And where the blast took place. </i> </p> <p>The firemen were in the middle of a row of vehicles parked outside the motel rooms, and were inserting a heavy fire-resistant blanket in through the framework that once held the SUV&#x2019;s front windshield. </p> <p>The wrecker raced up to the back bumper of the SUV, and a heavy-linked stainless-steel chain was quickly slung from the SUV&#x2019;s bumper to a tow hook bolted on the front frame of the wrecker. </p> <p>The driver ground the gearshift into reverse and carefully took up the slack in the chain. At a firefighter&#x2019;s rapid hand signals and shouts of &#x201c;Go! <i>Fuckin&#x2019; </i> go, go, go!&#x201d; the diesel engine then roared and the wrecker started tugging the SUV away from the fire. </p> <p>The wrecker didn&#x2019;t slow until it had slid the SUV practically in front of Harris&#x2019;s Crown Vic, leaving a trail of black tire marks across the parking lot. </p> <i><p>That&#x2019;s one of those really fancy Mercedes-Benz SUVs. </p> <p>What the hell is it doing here? </p> <p>And how the hell is it connected to that explosion? </p> <p>There&#x2019;s absolutely no question it has to be. . . . </p> </i> <p>One of the emergency medical vehicles then pulled alongside the passenger side of the SUV. Floodlights mounted on the side of the unit were switched on, brightly illuminating the SUV. Two firefighters almost instantly appeared, carrying a heavy metal device with hydraulically powered pincers that Harris recognized as the Jaws of Life. The rescue tool proceeded to cut the right side of the Mercedes to pieces as other rescuers worked feverishly from inside the left-side doors to stabilize whoever was unlucky enough to be in the vehicle. There suddenly was more shouting at the motel, and when Harris turned his attention to it he saw the impossible&#x2014;a man on fire came staggering out of the motel room that had the blown-outward door. </p> <p>One fireman rushed to the man. As he tackled him to smother the fire, a fire hose was trained on the both of them, instantly flooding the flames. Then the fireman stood and seemingly effortlessly slung the man over his shoulder. He ran with him&#x2014;slipping twice&#x2014;to the second ambulance, where the paramedics waited, ready to go to work. </p><br> <p>Forty-five minutes later, twenty minutes after the motel fire had been brought under control if not put out, Harris watched the emergency medical personnel remove from the SUV someone they&#x2019;d strapped to a rescue backboard. The victim looked to Harris to be a young woman. She had IV hoses dangling from her arm and wore an oxygen mask. Five minutes later, the doors of the ambulance slammed shut, and its siren wailed as the unit began to roll. As if on cue, the other ambulance did the same only a minute later. </p> <p>Harris scanned the motel and saw that the firemen were putting what Harris thought of as their toys back in their trucks. And he saw that the yellow and black police line&#x2014;do not cross tape was being strung up, signifying the scene was being turned over to the police. </p> <p><i>Well, now that all the excitement&#x2019;s over, </i> Harris thought, reaching for the door handle, <i>professional curiosity overwhelms me.</i> </p><br> <b><p>[TWO]<br> The Philly Inn<br> 7004 Frankford Avenue, Philadelphia<br> Wednesday, September 9, 1:15 A.M. </p> </b> <p>Forty minutes earlier, Becca Benjamin, despite having to wait in her silver Mercedes-Benz G550 at the back of a lousy Northeast Philly motel, had just reminded herself that she could not believe how much her luck had changed.

Her putative African lover, a doctor with one of the aid agencies, has disappeared. Her husband, Justin, a career diplomat and amateur gardener at the British High Commission in Nairobi, sets out on a personal odyssey in pursuit of the killers and their motive. His quest takes him to the Foreign Office in London, across Europe and Canada and back to Africa, to the depths of South Sudan, and finally to the very spot where Tessa died. On his way Justin meets terror, violence, laughter, conspiracy and knowledge. But his greatest discovery is the woman he barely had time to love.</p><p>British diplomat Justin Quayle, complacent raiser of freesias and doting husband of the stunning, much younger Tessa, has tended his own garden in Nairobi too long. Tessa is Justin's opposite, a fiery reformer, "that rarest thing, a lawyer who believes in justice," whose campaigns have earned her a nickname: "the Princess Diana of the African poor." But now Tessa has turned up naked, raped, and dead on a mysterious visit to remote Lake Turkana in Kenya. Her traveling companion (and lover?), the handsome Congolese-Belgian doctor Arnold Bluhm, has vanished. So has Quayle's complacency. <p> Tessa had been compiling data against a multinational drug company that uses helpless Africans as guinea pigs to test a tuberculosis remedy with unfortunately fatal side effects. Her report was destroyed by her husband's superiors; was she? It's all somehow connected to the sinister British firm House of ThreeBees, whose ad boasts that it's "buzzy for the health of Africa!"

He cleverly eludes their clammy embrace, turns spy, and takes off on a global chase to avenge Tessa and solve her murder. Le Carr� has lost none of his gift for setting vivid scenes in far-flung places expertly described: London, Germany, Saskatchewan, Kenya. His sprinting thriller prose remains in great shape. And thanks to his 16 years in the British Foreign Office, his merciless send-up of its cutthroat intrigues and petty self-delusions is unbelievably good--or rather, believably so. This is global do-gooder satire on a literary par with Doris Lessing's <i>The Summer Before the Dark</i>.</p><p> But you want to know if <i>The Constant Gardener</i> is as good as <i>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</i>. Very nearly. Africa's nightmare is more complex than the cold war chess match, and the world pharmaceutical circus is tougher to dramatize than the old spy-versus-spy-versus-spymaster game. Still, le Carr� can write a smart, melancholy page-turner, and his moral outrage (the real subject of his books) burns as brightly as ever. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>John le Carre was born in 1931. His third novel, THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD, secured him a wide reputation, which was consolidated by the acclaim for his trilogy, TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY, THE HONOURABLE SCHOOLBOY and SMILEY'S PEOPLE. His recent novels include his most autobiographical work, A PERFECT SPY, THE TAILOR OF PANAMA and SINGLE &amp; SINGLE.

Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>Two recent criminal cases--the 15 bodies found near Matamoros in Mexico in 1989 and the bludgeoning to death of a teenager in Joplin, Mo., in 1987--are merely the tip of a harrowing phenomenon, claims Raschke, director of the Institute for the Humanities at the University of Denver. The crimes represent clear instances of murder by satanic cults, which the author believes to be on the rise in the U.S., fed by the proliferating drug culture. Satanism, he argues, far from being a religion entitled to First Amendment protection, is "a motivational system for the spread of violence and cultural terrorism," often involving the torture and killing of animals and the sexual abuse of children. While Raschke's style is ponderous, the impact of his message is shocking.

But the country mapped out in this book, as Bruce Shapiro wrote in <i>The Nation</i>, "is not Woody Guthrie's land for made for you and me . . . It's what Marcus calls 'the old, weird America.'" This odd terrain, this strange yet familiar backdrop to our common cultural history--which Luc Sante (in <i>New York</i> magazine) termed the "playground of God, Satan, tricksters, Puritans, confidence men, illuminati, braggarts, preachers, anonymous poets of all stripes"--is the territory that Marcus has discovered in Dylan's most mysterious music. And his analysis of that territory "reads like a thriller" (Ken Tucker, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>) and exhibits "a mad, sparkling brilliance" (David Remnick, <i>The New Yorker</i>) throughout. This new edition of <i>The Old, Weird America</i> includes an updated discography.<br></p><p>One of America's most original and incisive critics of pop music and pop culture, Greil Marcus is the author of <i>Double Trouble</i>, <i>Dead Elvis</i>, <i>Lipstick Traces</i>, and <i>Mystery Train</i>. He lives in Berkeley, California.<br>ONE<br><br>&nbsp;<br>ANOTHER COUNTRY<br>In the dressing room in London, the guitarist was looking for a melody. He picked tiny notes off the strings until they fluttered, snapping in the air. The singer turned his head, caught the tune, the title flashing up: sure, &#x201c;Strange Things Happening Every Day,&#x201d; Sister Rosetta Tharpe, when was it, 1945? Closing in on Tharpe&#x2019;s own guitar line, the guitarist felt for the syncopation in the rhythm, and the song came to life in the singer&#x2019;s mind.<br>On that last great Judgment Day<br>When they drive them all away<br>There are strange things happening every day<br>She was shameless, the singer remembered: purer than pure when her mother was alive, backsliding after that. She came onto the Lord&#x2019;s stage in a mink; she had a way with a guitar few men could touch. She was the black church in the Grand Ole Opry&#x2014;she&#x2019;d even recorded with Pat Boone&#x2019;s father-in-law, Red Foley, Mr. &#x201c;Old Shep&#x201d; himself. On the other hand, Red Foley had recorded &#x201c;Peace in the Valley,&#x201d; hadn&#x2019;t he, the spiritual the Reverend Thomas A. Dorsey had written as the Second World War began? The sainted gospel composer, in earlier days known as Georgia Tom, who&#x2019;d put his name on dirty blues? The singer shook his head: why was he remembering all this? His memory raced ahead of him. For some reason he remembered that &#x201c;Strange Things Happening&#x201d; had topped the black charts the same week Hitler killed himself. It was April 30, 1945; the singer was a month short of four, Sister Rosetta Tharpe was thirty. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s something in the gospel blues,&#x201d; she would say years later, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s so deep the world can&#x2019;t stand it.&#x201d; Now he heard the song as if the war had ended yesterday, as if it were the first time he&#x2019;d heard it, wherever that had been&#x2014;off some road he&#x2019;d never remember anything else about, like waking from a dream you had to get up and live through.<br>If you want to view the crime<br>You must learn to quit your lyin&#x2019;<br>There are strange things happening every day<br>The guitarist was beginning to mumble the words, faking them, getting only the title phrase. The singer grinned as he made for the door. &#x201c;&#x2018;Strange things happening every day,&#x2019;&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;She got that right.&#x201d;<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Bob Dylan walked out of his dressing room in the Royal Albert Hall. It was May 26, 1966; for two weeks he&#x2019;d been up and down England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales. Two days before he&#x2019;d crossed the English Channel to celebrate his birthday onstage in Paris, dropping a huge American flag as the curtains opened for the second set, the crowd going mad with rage as if he were throwing America&#x2019;s war in Vietnam in their faces&#x2014;come on, hadn&#x2019;t they started it?&#x2014;then taking in the headline in&nbsp;<i>Le Figaro</i>&nbsp;the next day: &#x201c;LA CHUTE D&#x2019;UNE IDOLE.&#x201d; It was kind of a quiet night, actually, compared to&nbsp;... he&#x2019;d been in control. It wasn&#x2019;t usually like that, not this month, when the whole previous year felt like it was packed into a bomb that wouldn&#x2019;t stop exploding. Most nights abuse came raining down as if he could bring the weather with him, as if hate were the wind at his back, the storm waiting in every next town.<br>He walked out of his dressing room. He knew that when he sang his folk songs&#x2014;most of them no more folk songs than a Maytag washing machine, except unlike a Maytag washing machine they didn&#x2019;t rely on electricity&#x2014;a few older numbers, to please the crowd, or tease it, but mainly those long, odd songs that no longer made anyone laugh, &#x201c;Visions of Johanna,&#x201d; &#x201c;Mr. Tambourine Man,&#x201d; &#x201c;Desolation Row,&#x201d; when he stood still, picked strings, and appeared as any singer might have appeared in the years or centuries before him, the people in the audience would show respect, even approval. He knew that when he finished that set, left, and came back with the Hawks&#x2014;the piano player on one side of the stage, the organist on the other, the bass player and the guitarist at his sides, the drummer on a riser behind them&#x2014;the trouble would start; the problem was, he never knew just when it would start. &#x201c;How do you get your kicks these days?&#x201d; an interviewer asked him a few months before. &#x201c;I hire people to look into my eyes, and then I have them kick me,&#x201d; Dylan said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s how you get your kicks?&#x201d; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Dylan said, &#x201c;then I&nbsp;<i>forgive</i>&nbsp;them. That&#x2019;s where my kicks come in.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t that easy, though; once the second set began, it was as if the two sides&#x2014;the six on the stage, those in the crowd who had set themselves against them&#x2014;were trying most of all to drown each other out.<br>&#x201c;Dylan questions the comparisons drawn between charity rock events like Live Aid and USA for Africa and the student activism of yesteryear,&#x201d; a reporter wrote in 1985, then let Dylan speak: &#x201c;The big difference between now and the sixties is that then it was much more dangerous to do that sort of thing. There were people trying to stop the show any way they could&nbsp;... Then, you didn&#x2019;t know which end the trouble was coming from. And it could come at any time.&#x201d; He could have been talking about politics, in the narrow sense that the reporter was framing the issue; he could have been talking about the kind of politics that in 1966 occurred whenever he opened his mouth. And it was so stupid. Almost every night, the music lifted off the stage, so strong it was like a body, and there were moments when he couldn&#x2019;t believe he couldn&#x2019;t take his hand off his Fender Stratocaster and touch it. It was hard to hear, and hard to believe anything could ever be better. And then, at just that instant when the timing between a group of musicians was life itself, when the smallest mistake, the mistake you knew could never happen, would throw the world off its axis, when a physics no scientist would ever understand was all there was, the shouting would start, as if the audience that understood nothing understood one thing: ambush. A note, a chord, the start of a rhythm, and, then, &#x201c;COCKSUCKER.&#x201d;<br>On May 26, 1966, at the Royal Albert Hall, they were just about to move into &#x201c;Leopard-skin Pill-box Hat&#x201d;&#x2014;a yet-to-be-released&nbsp;<i>Blonde on Blonde</i>&nbsp;tune that after a month or so on the road had turned into a big, noisy, vulgar Chicago blues carrying hilariously sneering lyrics (&#x201c;I saw you making love with him / You forgot to close the garage door&#x201d;)&#x2014;when it started. The tape that survives from this night doesn&#x2019;t register the crowd; you can&#x2019;t hear what Bob Dylan is hearing, but by now his senses are strung so tightly any discord is painful, and even as you might imagine him standing straight to face the crowd, three decades later you can hear him sag. &#x201c;Oh, God,&#x201d; he says, like someone who has seen this too many times; the good lines that took him out of the dressing room, that great beat, are out of reach. The one shout he&#x2019;d caught from the crowd is already growing, the once-timid now screaming: TRAITOR. SELLOUT. MOTHERFUCKER. YOU&#x2019;RE NOT BOB DYLAN. And then laughter. &#x201c;Are you talking to me?&#x201d; Dylan says, theatrically; you can feel him strike a pose. There are more shouts; you can&#x2019;t decipher them, but he can. &#x201c;Come up here and say that,&#x201d; he says, and the great hall falls away. It is gone. We&#x2019;re in a bar in a town whose name you didn&#x2019;t catch when you drove in and won&#x2019;t remember to notice when you drive out, and in this bar &#x201c;Ballad of a Thin Man&#x201d; is all that is left.<br>In the fall of 1965, as the last song on the first side of the just-issued&nbsp;<i>Highway 61 Revisited</i>, the performance was almost laconic. Dylan&#x2019;s hipster piano, all reverb and menacing languor, led a high, ghostly organ sound, but mostly the music communicated distance, cool, disregard. There was more of the Midwest in Dylan&#x2019;s voice than in anything else on the disc&#x2014;more dust. The singer has seen it all before. You can&#x2019;t surprise him. Bearing down just slightly for the chorus, repeated again and again without change&#x2014;&#x201c;You know something is happening, but you don&#x2019;t know what it is&#x201d;&#x2014;on record Dylan found an instant catchphrase for the moral, generational, and racial divisions that in this moment found Americans defining themselves not as who they were but as who they were not, and he also found a commercial hook.&nbsp;<i>&#x201c;You know something&#x2019;s happening, but you&#x201d;</i>&#x2014;you could hear it everywhere over the next months, out of anyone&#x2019;s mouth. By definition, if you knew the song, you knew what was happening. If you wanted to know what was happening, or appear as if you did, you had to buy the album. Before the year was out,&nbsp;<i>Highway 61 Revisited</i>&nbsp;was only two places short of the top of the charts.<br>But on this tour, in May of 1966, up and down the British Isles, it is not this &#x201c;Ballad of a Thin Man&#x201d; that raises the bar it finds you in. Now it has become the most bitter, unstable song; with Dylan turning to the piano for this single number, it is also the song that is somehow most alive to the particular ambience of any given night, the weather, the frame of the hall, the mood of the crowd, sucking it up and using it like a karate fighter turning an opponent&#x2019;s strength against him. Some tunes in the set Dylan offers with the Hawks&#x2014;&#x201c;Tell Me, Momma,&#x201d; &#x201c;Baby Let Me Follow You Down,&#x201d; &#x201c;One Too Many Mornings,&#x201d; &#x201c;I Don&#x2019;t Believe You&#x201d;&#x2014;fly or they don&#x2019;t, but formally they are always the same. &#x201c;Ballad of a Thin Man&#x201d; is always different, always changed by the crowd, then moving as if to change it in turn.<br>The song begins and ends with the oldest, corniest beatnik clich�: the square. Some poor sap, well dressed, well heeled. As a listener, in the crowd, you&#x2019;re set up to imagine him as whoever you&#x2019;re not. The song puts him through the wringer. Always at home in the streets of his town, he is now trapped in a demimonde, in an after-hours club where he is neither welcome nor permitted to leave. He&#x2019;s heard about the kind of people who inhabit these places: drug addicts, homosexuals, Negroes, intellectuals, homosexual Negro intellectuals like the funny-looking man with the beret and the popeyes. The square has seen the man&#x2019;s picture in the papers; he&#x2019;s even seen his like, men and women, black and white, in the streets. They used to live in the shadows; now they appear in public, as if the town is theirs.<br>The square watches as a man in high heels kneels at his feet and smiles up at him like a snake. He&#x2019;s taken into a room where everyone is shouting slogans, the kind of slogans the square has seen on the protest placards people carry on their marches, but here the slogans are in a different language, if it is a language at all: &#x201c;NOW,&#x201d; they say blankly; &#x201c;YOU&#x2019;RE A COW.&#x201d; The square wants to run but he doesn&#x2019;t even know where he is&#x2014;and by now whoever is listening is beginning to recognize his or her own dim shape in the song. Whoever is listening is beginning to flinch.<br>The walls of the Albert Hall rise up again, the noise from the crowd stays constant, but seated at the piano Dylan starts the music. The song is a blues, no more, on some nights the biggest blues anyone has ever heard, with Garth Hudson&#x2019;s organ finding a mode so mocking it is sadistic, a whirlpool opening and then laughing at your fear as it closes, with Robbie Robertson&#x2019;s first guitar notes enormous, Godzilla notes, so big they throw the audience back, daring anyone to say the first word&#x2014;but not this night.<br>On this night, the last night but one of these weeks in the United Kingdom, the last time but one this music would ever be played, no one is thrown back. Instead wounds are exposed, and the ugly sight quiets the crowd. &#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d; Dylan asks Robbie Robertson, just three weeks past twenty-two; Bob Dylan is an old man, twenty-five years and two days. The crowd can&#x2019;t hear the singer whispering to the man at his side as if he&#x2019;s never been less sure of anything, but they can feel the way he&#x2019;s hovering, or tottering, and the sight is a kind of violence, a terror, a negative, a nothing.<br>Here it is: nothing. Here you are, all of you. It will take four thousand holes to fill the Albert Hall, and four thousand times nothing is nothing.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Even as recorded on&nbsp;<i>Bringing It All Back Home</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Highway 61 Revisited</i>, the songs Bob Dylan began offering in 1965, most with rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll accompaniment rattling and grand, took shape as treasure maps, and the treasure toward which they pointed was a still-undiscovered sound. By the spring of 1966 the songs had become the treasure. The tale of how this transformation came about is inseparable from the tale of how the music was received. In 1965 and 1966 Bob Dylan&#x2019;s music made a social drama, a drama that resisted all the charms of resolution.<br>It began at the Newport Folk Festival without any plan. On June 16, in New York City, Dylan had recorded &#x201c;Like a Rolling Stone&#x201d; with a band that included New Yorker Al Kooper on organ and Chicagoan Mike Bloomfield, of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, on lead guitar; meeting up with the two in Rhode Island on July 24, the day &#x201c;Like a Rolling Stone&#x201d; went into the charts, the notion of a festival surprise seemed irresistible. Electric music had never been played at Newport, but the Butterfield band was itself set for a blues workshop; the equipment was there. Completing a pickup band with pianist Barry Goldberg, plus Butterfield&#x2019;s drummer Sam Lay and his bassist Jerome Arnold, Dylan rehearsed through the night and showed up the next day, on Newport&#x2019;s main stage, ready to experiment. Pete Seeger, the paragon of the folk revival, the man who represented all of its compassion and nobility, who as the son of the revered folk scholar Charles Seeger embodied a whole, people&#x2019;s enactment of an American folk century, had begun the evening by playing a recording of the cry of a newborn baby. He asked that everyone in the audience sing to the baby, that they tell it into what sort of world it had been born&#x2014;and &#x201c;he already knew,&#x201d; wrote Jim Rooney, a mainstay of the folk scene in Cambridge, Massachusetts, &#x201c;what he wanted others to sing. They were going to sing that it was a world of pollution, bombs, hunger, and injustice, but that PEOPLE would OVERCOME.&#x201d; That was the call. Then Bob Dylan took his turn.<br>Watching the film of this night, one can see eager young men&#x2014;Dylan and Mike Bloomfield in particular&#x2014;taking their cues straight from&nbsp;<i>High Noon</i>, or the one-on-one shootouts that throughout their teenage years opened and closed almost every episode of&nbsp;<i>Gunsmoke.</i>&nbsp;Cheers greeted a simpering introduction by Peter Yarrow of the folk trio Peter, Paul &amp; Mary, which two years before had made Dylan&#x2019;s &#x201c;Blowin&#x2019; in the Wind&#x201d; a huge national hit and a touchstone of the era&#x2014;&#x201c;The person who&#x2019;s coming up now, is a person who has, in a sense, changed the face of folk music, to the&nbsp;<i>large American public</i>, because he has brought to it, the point of view of a&nbsp;<i>poet</i>&#x201d;&#x2014;but as the band took the stage and commenced tuning up the crowd was quiet.<br>Dylan&#x2019;s cry of &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go!&#x201d; is like a leap out of a plane. He leans back on his bootheels, as if daring gravity, an erotic nimbus of certainty and pleasure around his face. Bloomfield crouches low, holding his guitar as a rifle with bayonet fixed, lunging for the sound with crackling noise every time Dylan takes a breath. Dylan is shouting out the caustic black humor of &#x201c;Maggie&#x2019;s Farm&#x201d; without range, without any need for it, as if he&#x2019;s just discovered that as a singer he can stomp his foot through the boards.

The main purpose of this volume was to incorporate all of the basic theories, concepts, and principles discussed in the four earlier volumes together, to achieve a more complete understanding of how these mental and physical aspects relate, function, and apply. Acquiring this knowledge not only develops refined techniques, but also can result in success in combat. Mr. Parker states that &#34;combat without preparation can prove disastrous&#34;, he believed that realistic preparations must be made to overcome environmental conditions, unpredictable events, or to curtail an opponent whose unorthodox actions and reactions can unexpectedly create variables that may cause defeat. Realizing that an attack can dictate and direct one&#39;s defense, Mr. Parker shared the need o learn combat in total. Mr. Parker concludes this capstone volume with the cornerstone and keystone firmly in place. The years he spent analyzing, scrutinizing, creating and developing his system of American Kenpo were now logically, practically, and sequentially set in place for future students to build on. Grounded, rooted, and established on a firm foundation, students could be secure in the knowledge that this foundation &#34;Art and Science of Street fighting&#34; could consistently be built upon employing existing correct principles.</p><p>The late Sr. Kenpo Grandmaster Ed Parker Sr. known as the Father of American Kenpo Karate and founder of the International Karate Championships in Long Beach, California.

Colorful and comprehensive, The Baseball Encyclopedia is recognized by Major League Baseball as the official record of the game and its players.</p><p>The seventh edition of this vital work was hailed in Mike Shannon's Diamond Classics ( LJ 8/89) as "the best and most complete record book . . . on any single game or sport." This eighth edition has revised, updated, and enlarged the 1988 version both in physical size and content. Along with team and player records and special achievements, rules, and sidelights as in the previous edition, the new work introduces complete fielding records, new and improved home/road records, a section on star Negro League players, and a new introductory history of the game. Succeeding the late Joe Reichler as editor, Wolff has assembled a staff of first-rate researchers and writers; a random check of 20 records revealed eight had been updated. Although it is regrettable that umpires are not covered, this thorough revision is an essential reference source for any sports collection.<br><i>- Morey Berger, formerly with Monmouth Cty.

As the only authorized posthumous autobiography, Edith Head&#39;s Hollywood, the twenty-fifth anniversary edition tells her remarkable story the definitive book by and about the woman whose name is synonymous with Hollywood costume design. Through six decades of Hollywood fashion, Edith Head dressed the screen&#39;s best Dietrich, Lombard, the Hepburns (Audrey and Kate), Hope and Crosby, Grace Kelly and Elvis Presley, to name a few. She won an unprecedented eight Oscars for her spectacular creations. As Bette Davis says in her Foreword, &#34;You&#39;ll read her story the way she would have told it and, indeed, did tell it . . .&#34;</p><p>In the winter of 1962, a time of three gargantuan broadcast networks and a power-wielding block of national advertisers, a relatively tiny ornament called Mr. Magoo&#x2019;s Christmas Carol would herald a family holiday TV tradition that has all but slipped into obscurity in the wake of the numerous Christmas specials that it inspired. Now animation director Darrell Van Citters, in a meticulously researched and delightfully engaging story&#x2014;told with dozens of production art images and rarely seen photographs&#x2014;has captured that golden era of TV animation in this richly illustrated book. It&#x2019;s a detailed retelling&#x2014;in the voices of many of the artists who created it&#x2014;of the painstaking and often frustrating efforts to translate Charles Dickens&#x2019; timeless holiday tale into a Broadway-style musical for the small screen&#x2014;the first ever of its kind. It took an amazing, quirky confluence of unlikely events to bring Mr. Magoo&#x2019;s Christmas Carol to life, the first (and one of the most beloved) of all animated television Christmas specials. Marketing whiz Henry Saperstein&#x2019;s purchase and revival of the once innovative but foundering UPA studios; visionary UPA producer Lee Orgel&#x2019;s lightning flash of an idea to cast the comical character Mr. Magoo in a serious role as Scrooge; Orgel&#x2019;s enlistment of veteran director Abe Levitow (simultaneously directing the much higher profile feature Gay Purr-ee); and the hiring of Broadway composers Jule Styne and Bob Merrill, whose struggles to get Funny Girl into production left them time to write songs for an unlikely (and very nearsighted) Scrooge. This affectionate, often suspenseful narrative in words and images is a must-have for fans of the special as well as animation and Broadway aficionados. Relive an era of pioneering TV programming, the birth of long-form animated storytelling on television, and rediscover this gem of a Christmas classic that set the stage for all that followed it&#x2014;welcome to the story of Mr. Magoo&#x2019;s Christmas Carol!Darrell Van Citters is a well-known director and producer with over thirty years in animation. His career began at the Walt Disney Studios, as animator on The Fox and the Hound, director of the animated short (and cult classic) Fun with Mr. Future, and development on Who Framed Roger Rabbit. He moved to Warner Bros. Animation and Chuck Jones Productions, where he directed the Bugs Bunny short Box Office Bunny, a pair of memorable Super Bowl Nike ads starring Bugs Bunny and Michael Jordan and, for Jones, the Foghorn Leghorn cartoon Pullet Surprise. He finally hung out his own shingle at Renegade Animation, where for the past seventeen years he has worked on or overseen numerous television commercials and such diverse projects as The Hi Hi Puffy Ami Yumi Show, Christmas Is Here Again and Funny Face, based on the 1960s Pillsbury characters. His experience as animator, director and business owner gives him a distinctive viewpoint for writing about animation. Mr. Magoo&#x2019;s Christmas Carol has long been one of his favorites. He has occasionally written articles and editorials for animation and trade magazines. This is his first book.</p><h2>Jimmy the Hand: Legends of the Riftwar, Book III (Legends of the Riftwar, 3)</h2><p><p> Jimmy the Hand, boy thief of Krondor, lived in the shadows of the city. The sewers were his byways and a flea-ridden, rat-infested cellar his home. Although gifted beyond his peers, he was still but a nimble street urchin, a pickpocket with potential. Until the day he met Prince Arutha. </p> <p> Aiding the Prince in his rescue of Princess Anita from imprisonment by Duke Guy du Bas-Tyra, Jimmy runs afoul of Black Guy's secret police. Given the choice of disappearing on his own or in a weighted barrel at the bottom of Krondor's harbor, Jimmy flees the only home he's ever known, venturing south to the relatively safe haven of Land's End. Suspecting that the rural villagers have never encountered a lad with his talent and nose for finding wealth&#x2014;other people's wealth&#x2014;he's fairly optimistic about his broadening horizons. But Jimmy is completely unprepared for what greets him. </p> <p> For Land's End is home to others who tread the crooked path, and more, to a much darker secret: a dangerous presence unknown even to the local thieves and smugglers. And Jimmy's youthful bravado and courage will plunge him deep into the maw of chaos and even&#x2014;if he isn't careful&#x2014;death. </p></p><p><p><strong>Raymond E.

Krondor's ever-resourceful boy thief, not content with helping Princess Anita and Prince Arutha make a seaward escape from the city's viceroy, rescues Hotfingers Flora and some unlucky fellow thieves from prison. Jimmy goes into exile with grateful Flora, hoping to find her Land's End relatives, and soon winds up aiding another damsel in distress: fellow teenager Lorrie Merford, searching for her younger brother, who was kidnapped by her parents' killers. This simple, charming fairy tale will appeal to adult fans of the Riftwar books as well as mature teens who don't mind a bit of romance in their sword-and-sorcery. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This work, with its comprehensive command history, clear action, and vivid but humane narrative, has none of those. The first all-South Vietnamese offensive into Laos in early 1971 produced both an interruption of Northern buildups and a test of Vietnamization of the war, but despite a 10-to-1 casualty ratio and tons of captured supplies was seen to be so savage and damaging to the South and to American support forces that much of the military and the press deemed it a defeat. Nolan's arguments that it had positive effects are well presented and convincing. A powerful and thoughtful history of a neglected action. Mel D.

His spiritual classics include The Seven Storey Mountain, New Seeds of Contemplation, and The Sign of Jonas.Like the first two volumes of Merton's journals, this third volume is full of insight into his life and work. Readers will be grateful that when it came to his journals, Merton's Trappist silence did not leave him speechless. In a 1956 entry, he notes that he had "always wanted to write about everything" --not to write a book that "covers everything" or contains everything, but "a book in which everything can go." The journals accomplish this largely by avoiding what he refers to (in a 1958 entry) as "the apostolate of alienation and hatred," a "mania for making everyone else like oneself." Merton's great gift, which shines through in the bits and pieces of his journals even more than in his finished work, is an ability to listen and respond to a world in which everything does go. Lawrence Cunningham notes in his introduction that Merton's journals are full of reflection on what it means to be a monk. In this volume, as in the second one, that reflection plays a major role in shaping his discernment of the world and his place in it. This volume maintains the high standards established in the first two and will leave readers anxiously anticipating the remaining four. <i>Steve Schroeder</i></p><h2>Realizing the Power of Now: An In-Depth Retreat with Eckhart Tolle</h2><p><p>Perhaps you can recall a time when you felt more alive than at any other moment&#x2015;when you had a sudden recognition of beauty, a feeling of deep contentment, and a sense of connection with life greater than you had ever thought possible.

I saw a strange stranger on the beach this morning. I had been swimming in the little bay between here and the village; that may have had something to do with it, although I did not feel tired. Dived down and thought I saw a shark coming around the big staghorn coral. Got out fast. The whole swim cannot have been more than ten minutes. Ran out of the water and started walking.<br>There it is. I have begun this journal at last. (Thought I never would.) So let us return to all the things I ought to have put in and did not. I bought this the day after I came back from Africa.<br>No, the day I got out of the hospital--I remember now. I was wandering around, wondering when I would have another attack, and went into a little shop on Forty-second Street. There was a nice-looking woman in there, one of those good-looking black women, and I thought it might be nice to talk to her, so I had to buy something. I said, "I just got back from Africa."<br>She: "Really. How was it?" Me: "Hot."<br>Anyway, I came out with this notebook and told myself I had not wasted my money because I would keep a journal, writing down my attacks, what I had been doing and eating, as instructed; but all I could think of was how she looked when she turned to go to the back of the shop. Her legs and how she held her head. Her hips.<br>After that I planned to write down everything I remember from Africa, and what we said if Mary returned my calls. Then it was going to be about this assignment.<br>* * *<br>31 Jan. Setting up my new Mac. Who would think this place would have phones? But there are wires to Kololahi, and a dish. I can chat with people all over the world, for which the agency pays. (Talk about soft!) Nothing like this in Africa. Just the radio, and good luck with that.<br>I was full of enthusiasm. "A remote Pacific island chain." Wait...<br>P.D.: "Baden, we're going to send you to the Takanga Group."<br>No doubt I looked blank.<br>"It's a remote Pacific island chain." She cleared her throat and seemed to have swallowed a bone. "It's not going to be like Africa, Bad. You'll be on your own out there."<br>Me: "I thought you were going to fire me."<br>P.D.: "No, no! We wouldn't do that."<br>"Permanent sick leave."<br>"No, no, no! But, Bad." She leaned across her desk and for a minute I was afraid she was going to squeeze my hand. "This will be rough. I'm not going to try to fool you."<br>Hah!<br>Cut to the chase. This is nothing. This is a bungalow with rotten boards in the floors that has been here since before the British pulled out, a mile from the village and less than half that from the beach, close enough that the Pacific-smell is in all the rooms. The people are fat and happy, and my guess is not more than half are dumb. (Try and match that around Chicago.) Once or twice a year one gets yaws or some such, and Rev. Robbins gives him arsenic. <i>Which cures it</i>. Pooey!<br>There are fish in the ocean, plenty of them. Wild fruit in the jungle, and they know which you can eat. They plant yams and breadfruit, and if they need money or just want something, they dive for pearls and trade them when Jack's boat comes. Or do a big holiday boat trip to Kololahi.<br>There are coconuts, too, which I forgot. They know how to open them. Or perhaps I am just not strong enough yet. (I look in the mirror, and ugh.) I used to weigh two hundred pounds.<br>"You skinny," the king says. "Ha, ha, ha!" He is really a good guy, I think. He has a primitive sense of humor, but there are worse things. He can take a jungle chopper (we said upanga but they say heletay) and open a coconut like a pack of gum. I have coconuts and a heletay but I might as well try to open them with a spoon.<br>* * *<br>1 Feb. Nothing to report except a couple of wonderful swims. I did not swim at all for the first couple of weeks. There are sharks. I know they are really out there because I have seen them once or twice. According to what I was told, there are saltwater crocs, too, up to fourteen feet long. I have never seen any of those and am skeptical, although I know they have them in Queensland. Every so often you hear about somebody who was killed by a shark, but that does not stop the people from swimming all the time, and I do not see why it should stop me. Good luck so far.<br>* * *<br>2 Feb. Saturday. I was supposed to write about the dwarf I saw on the beach that time, but I never got the nerve. Sometimes I used to see things in the hospital. Afraid it may be coming back. I decided to take a walk on the beach. All right, did I get sunstroke?<br>Pooey.<br>He was just a little man, shorter even than Mary's father. He was too small for any adult in the village. He was certainly not a child, and was too pale to have been one of the islanders at all.<br>He cannot have been here long; he was whiter than I am.<br>Rev. Robbins will know--ask tomorrow.<br>* * *<br>3 Feb. Hot and getting hotter. Jan. is the hottest month here, according to Rob Robbins. Well, I got here the first week in Jan. and it has never been this hot.<br>Got up early while it was still cool. Went down the beach to the village. (Stopped to have a look at the rocks where the dwarf disappeared.) Waited around for the service to begin but could not talk to Rob, he was rehearsing the choir--"Nearer My God to Thee."<br>Half the village came, and the service went on for almost two hours. When it was over I was able to get Rob alone. I said if he would drive us into Kololahi I would buy our Sunday dinner. (He has a jeep.) He was nice, but no--too far and the bad roads. I told him I had personal troubles I wanted his advice on, and he said, "Why don't we go to your place, Baden, and have a talk? I'd invite you for lemonade, but they'd be after me every minute."<br>So we walked back. It was hotter than hell, and this time I tried not to look. I got cold Cokes out of my rusty little fridge, and we sat on the porch (Rob calls it the veranda) and fanned ourselves. He knew I felt bad about not being able to do anything for these people, and urged patience. My chance would come.<br>I said, "I've given up on that, Reverend."<br>(That was when he told me to call him Rob. His first name is Mervyn.) "Never give up, Baden. Never." He looked so serious I almost laughed.<br>"All right, I'll keep my eyes open, and maybe someday the Agency will send me someplace where I'm needed."<br>"Back to Uganda?"<br>I explained that the A.O.A.A. almost never sends anyone to the same area twice. "That wasn't really what I wanted to talk to you about. It's my personal life. Well, really two things, but that's one of them. I'd like to get back together with my ex-wife. You're going to advise me to forget it, because I'm here and she's in Chicago; but I can send e-mail, and I'd like to put the bitterness behind us."<br>"Were there children? Sorry, Baden. I didn't intend it to hurt."<br>I explained how Mary had wanted them and I had not, and he gave me some advice. I have not e-mailed yet, but I will tonight after I write it out here.<br>"You're afraid that you were hallucinating. Did you feel feverish?" He got out his thermometer and took my temperature, which was nearly normal. "Let's look at it logically, Baden. This island is a hundred miles long and about thirty miles at the widest point. There are eight villages I know of. The population of Kololahi is over twelve hundred."<br>I said I understood all that.<br>"Twice a week, the plane from Cairns brings new tourists."<br>"Who almost never go five miles from Kololahi."<br>"Almost never, Baden. Not never. You say it wasn't one of the villagers. All right, I accept that. Was it me?"<br>"Of course not."<br>"Then it was someone from outside the village, someone from another village, from Kololahi, or a tourist. Why shake your head?"<br>I told him.<br>"I doubt there's a leprosarium nearer than the Marshalls. Anyway, I don't know of one closer. Unless you saw something else, some other sign of the disease, I doubt that this little man you saw had leprosy. It's a lot more likely that you saw a tourist with pasty white skin greased with sun blocker. As for his disappearing, the explanation seems pretty obvious. He dived off the rocks into the bay."<br>"There wasn't anybody there. I looked."<br>"There wasn't anybody there you saw, you mean. He would have been up to his neck in water, and the sun was glaring on the water, wasn't it?"<br>"I suppose so."<br>"It must have been. The weather's been clear." Rob drained his Coke and pushed it away. "As for his not leaving footprints, stop playing Sherlock Holmes. That's harsh, I realize, but I say it for your own good. Footprints in soft sand are shapeless indentations at best."<br>"I could see mine."<br>"You knew where to look. Did you try to backtrack yourself? I thought not. May I ask a few questions? When you saw him, did you think he was real?"<br>"Yes, absolutely. Would you like another one? Or something to eat?"<br>"No, thanks. When was the last time you had an attack?"<br>"A bad one? About six weeks."<br>"How about a not-bad one?"<br>"Last night, but it didn't amount to much. Two hours of chills, and it went away."<br>"That must have been a relief. No, I see it wasn't. Baden, the next time you have an attack, severe or not, I want you to come and see me. Understand?"<br>I promised.<br>* * *<br><i>This is Bad. I still love you. That's all I have to ay, but I want to say it. I was wrong, and I know it. I hope you've forgiven me</i>. And sign off.<br>* * *<br>4 Feb. Saw him again last night, and he has pointed teeth. I was shaking under the netting, and he looked through the window and smiled. Told Rob, and said I read somewhere that cannibals used to file their teeth. I know these people were cannibals three or four generations back, and I asked if they had done it. He thinks not but will ask the king.<br>* * *<br><i>I have been very ill, Mary, but I feel better now. It is evening here, and I am going to bed. I love you. Good night. I love you</i>. Sign off.<br>* * *<br>5 Feb. Two men with spears came to take me to the king. I asked if I was under arrest, and they laughed. No ha, ha, ha from His Majesty this time, though. He was in the big house, but he came out and we went some distance among hardwoods the size of office buildings smothered in flowering vines, stopping in a circle of stones: the king, the men with spears, and an old man with a drum. The men with spears built a fire, and the drum made soft sounds like waves while the king made a speech or recited a poem, mocked all the while by invisible birds with eerie voices.<br>When the king was finished, he hung this piece of carved bone around my neck. While we were walking back to the village, he put his arm around me, which surprised me more than anything. He is bigger than a tackle in the NFL, and must weigh four hundred pounds. It felt like I was carrying a calf.<br>* * *<br>Horrible, <i>horrible</i> dreams! Swimming in boiling blood. Too scared to sleep anymore. Logged on and tried to find something on dreams and what they mean. Stumbled onto a witch in L.A.--her home page, then the lady herself. (I'll get you and your little dog, too!) Actually, she seemed nice.<br>Got out the carved bone thing the king gave me. Old, and probably ought to be in a museum, but I suppose I had better wear it as long as I stay here, at least when I go out. Suppose I were to offend him? He might sit on me! Seems to be a fish with pictures scratched into both sides. More fish, man in a hat, etc. Cord through the eye. Wish I had a magnifying glass.<br>* * *<br>6 Feb. Still haven't gone back to bed, but my watch says Wednesday. Wrote a long e-mail, typing it in as it came to me. Told her where I am and what I'm doing, and begged her to respond. After that I went outside and swam naked in the moonlit sea. Tomorrow I want to look for the place where the king hung this fish charm on me. Back to bed.<br>* * *<br>Morning, and beautiful. Why has it taken me so long to see what a beautiful place this is? (Maybe my heart just got back from Africa.) Palms swaying forever in the trade winds, and people like heroic bronze statues. How small, how stunted and pale we have to look to them!<br>Took a real swim to get the screaming out of my ears. Will I laugh in a year when I see that I said my midnight swim made me understand these people better? Maybe I will. But it did. They have been swimming in the moon like that for hundreds of years.<br>* * *<br>E-mail! God bless e-mail and whoever invented it! Just checked mine and found I had a message. Tried to guess who it might be. I wanted Mary, and was about certain it would be from the witch, from Annys. Read the name and it was <i>Julius R. Christmas</i>. Pops! Mary's Pops! Got up and ran around the room, so excited I could not read it. Now I have printed it out, and I am going to copy it here.<br>* * *<br><i>She went to Uganda looking for you, Bad. Coming back tomorrow, Kennedy, AA 47 from Heathrow. I'll tell her where you are. Watch out for those hula-hula girls.</i><br><i>* * *</i><br>SHE WENT TO UGANDA LOOKING FOR ME<br><i>* * *</i><br>7 Feb. More dreams--little man with pointed teeth smiling through the window. I doubt that I should write it all down, but I knew (in the dream) that he hurt people, and he kept telling me he would not hurt me. Maybe the first time was a dream, too. More screams.<br>Anyway, I talked to Rob again yesterday afternoon, although I had not planned on it. By the time I got back here I was too sick to do anything except lie on the bed. The worst since I left the hospital, I think.<br>Went looking for the place the king took me to. Did not want to start from the village, kids might have followed me, so I tried to circle and come at it from the other side. Found two old buildings, small and no roofs, and a bone that looked human. More about that later. Did not see any marks, but did not look for them either. It was black on one end like it had been in a fire, though.<br>Kept going about three hours and wore myself out. Tripped on a chunk of stone and stopped to wipe off the sweat, and Blam! I was there! Found the ashes and where the king and I stood. Looked around wishing I had my camera, and there was Rob, sitting up on four stones that were still together and looking down at me. I said, "Hey, why didn't you say something?"<br>And he said, "I wanted to see what you would do." So he had been spying on me; I did not say it, but that was what it was.<br>I told him about going there with the king, and how he gave me a charm. I said I was sorry I had not worn it, but anytime he wanted a Coke I would show it to him.<br>"It doesn't matter. He knows you're sick, and I imagine he gave you something to heal you. It might even work, because God hears all sorts of prayers. That's not what they teach in the seminary, or even what it says in the Bible. But I've been out in the missions long enough to know. When somebody with good intentions talks to the God who created him, he's heard. Pretty often the answer is yes. Why did you come back here?"<br>"I wanted to see it again, that's all. At first I thought it was just a circle of rocks, then when I thought about it, it seemed like it must have been more."<br>Rob kept quiet; so I explained that I had been thinking of Stonehenge. Stonehenge was a circle of big rocks, but the idea had been to look at the positions of certain stars and where the sun rose. But this could not be the sam...</p><h2>From Dawn to Decadence</h2><p>Drawing on a lifetime of studies across a broad territory, highly regarded cultural historian and critic Jacques Barzun here synthesizes the sum of his discoveries and conclusions about the whole of Western culture since 1500. The triumphs and defeats of five hundred years form an inspiring saga which modifies the current impression of Western history as one long tale of oppression by white European males. Women and their deeds are prominent, and freedom (even in sexual matters) is not an invention of the last decades. And when Barzun rates the present not as a culmination of history, but as a decline, he is in no way a prophet of doom. Instead, he shows that decadence is the normal close to a great period, and a necessary condition of the creative novelty that will burst forth--tomorrow, or the next day.</p><p>In the last half-millennium, as the noted cultural critic and historian Jacques Barzun observes, great revolutions have swept the Western world. Each has brought profound change--for instance, the remaking of the commercial and social worlds wrought by the rise of Protestantism and by the decline of hereditary monarchies. And each, Barzun hints, is too little studied or appreciated today, in a time he does not hesitate to label as decadent.<p> To leaf through Barzun's sweeping, densely detailed but lightly written survey of the last 500 years is to ride a whirlwind of world-changing events. Barzun ponders, for instance, the tumultuous political climate of Renaissance Italy, which yielded mayhem and chaos, but also the work of Michelangelo and Leonardo--and, he adds, the scientific foundations for today's consumer culture of boom boxes and rollerblades. He considers the 16th-century varieties of religious experimentation that arose in the wake of Martin Luther's 95 theses, some of which led to the repression of individual personality, others of which might easily have come from the "Me Decade." Along the way, he offers a miniature history of the detective novel, defends Surrealism from its detractors, and derides the rise of professional sports, packing in a wealth of learned and often barbed asides.</p><p> Never shy of controversy, Barzun writes from a generally conservative position; he insists on the importance of moral values, celebrates the historical contributions of Christopher Columbus, and twits the academic practitioners of political correctness. Whether accepting of those views or not, even the most casual reader will find much that is new or little-explored in this attractive venture into cultural history. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><p><strong>Jacques Barzun </strong>(1907-2012)<strong> </strong>was born in France and came to the United States in 1920. After graduating from Columbia College, he joined the faculty of the university, becoming Seth Low Professor of History and, for a decade, dean of faculties and provost. The author of some thirty books, he received the Gold Medal for Criticism from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, of which he was twice president.</p></p><h2>The Summoning (Forgotten Realms: Return of the Archwizards, Book 1)</h2><p>From the depths of the demiplane of shadow comes a new magic so mysterious it confounds even the Chosen of Mystra.<br><br>From beneath the dune seas of Anauroch escapes one of Toril's most powerful and ancient evils -- the phaerimm.<br><br>From Evereska, the last elven refuge on comes word of invasion.<br><br>From nowhere appears a group of enigmatic sorcerers determined to destroy the phaerimm and save Evereska . . . for purposes known only to themselves.<br><br>From the author of <i>Crucible: The Trial of Cyric the Mad, Beyond the High Road, </i>and <i>Death of the Dragon</i> (with Ed Greenwood) comes the most Realms-shaking event since <i>The Threat from the Sea.</i><br></p><p></p><h2>The Good Soldier (Vintage Classics)</h2><p><i><b>"One of the finest novels of our century."&nbsp; &#x2014;Graham Greene</b></i>&nbsp;<i>The Good Soldier</i> is a brilliant and heart-rending evocation of destructive passion. When John Dowell and his wife befriend Edward and Leonora Ashburnham they appear to be the perfect couple. He is a distinguished soldier and she is beautiful and intelligent. However, what lies beneath the surface of their marriage is far more sinister and their influence leads John into a tragic drama that threatens to destroy everything he cares about.</p><p>First published in 1915, Ford Madox Ford's <i>The Good Soldier</i> begins, famously and ominously, "This is the saddest story I have ever heard." The book then proceeds to confute this pronouncement at every turn, exposing a world less sad than pathetic, and more shot through with hypocrisy and deceit than its incredulous narrator, John Dowell, cares to imagine. Somewhat forgotten as a classic, <i>The Good Soldier</i> has been called everything from the consummate novelist's novel to one of the greatest English works of the century. And although its narrative hook--the philandering of an otherwise noble man--no longer shocks, its unerring cadences and doleful inevitabilities proclaim an enduring appeal.<p> Ford's novel revolves around two couples: Edward Ashburnham--the title's soldier--and his capable if off-putting wife, Leonora; and long-transplanted Americans John and Florence Dowell. The foursome's ostensible amiability, on display as they pass parts of a dozen pre-World War I summers together in Germany, conceals the fissures in each marriage. John is miserably mismatched with the garrulous, cuckolding Florence; and Edward, dashing and sentimental, can't refrain from falling in love with women whose charms exceed Leonora's. Predictably, Edward and Florence conduct their affair, an indiscretion only John seems not to notice. After the deaths of the two lovers, and after Leonora explains much of the truth to John, he recounts the events of their four lives with an extended inflection of outrage. From his retrospective perch, his recollections simmer with a bitter skepticism even as he expresses amazement at how much he overlooked.</p><p> Dowell's resigned narration is flawlessly conversational--haphazard, sprawling, lusting for sympathy. He exudes self-preservation even as he alternately condemns and lionizes Edward: "If I had had the courage and the virility and possibly also the physique of Edward Ashburnham I should, I fancy, have done much what he did." Stunningly, Edward's adultery comes to seem not merely excusable, but almost sublime. "Perhaps he could not bear to see a woman and not give her the comfort of his physical attractions," John surmises. Ford's novel deserves its reputation if for no other reason than the elegance with which it divulges hidden lives. <i>--Ben Guterson</i></p>Ford Madox Ford wrote The Good Soldier, the book on which his reputation most surely rests, in deliberate emulation of the nineteenth-century French novels he so admired. In this way he was able to explore the theme of sexual betrayal and its poisonous after-effects with a psychological intimacy as yet unknown in the English novel.</p><h2>Quicksand: An Eve Duncan Forensics Thriller</h2><p><p><i>Do you still miss your little Bonnie? </i>This one sentence, spoken by a male voice in anonymous phone call, is all it takes to drag Eve Duncan right back to that horrifying moment years ago when her only daughter vanished without a trace.

Normal people give up after ten or eleven, unless it&#x2019;s a matter of<br>life or death. Don&#x2019;t they? Dad&#x2019;s got an answering machine like James Garner&#x2019;s<br>in <i>The Rockford Files </i>with big reels of tape. But he&#x2019;s stopped leaving it<br>switched on recently. Thirty rings, the phone got to. Julia couldn&#x2019;t hear it up<br>in her converted attic &#x2019;cause &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t You Want Me?&#x201d; by Human League was<br>thumping out dead loud. <i>Forty </i>rings. Mum couldn&#x2019;t hear &#x2019;cause the washing<br>machine was on berserk cycle <i>and </i>she was hoovering the living room. <i>Fifty<br></i>rings. That&#x2019;s just not normal. S&#x2019;pose Dad&#x2019;d been mangled by a juggernaut on<br>the M5 and the police only had this office number &#x2019;cause all his other I.D.&#x2019;d<br>got incinerated? We could lose our final chance to see our charred father in<br>the terminal ward.<br>So I went in, thinking of a bride going into Bluebeard&#x2019;s chamber after<br>being told not to. (Bluebeard, mind, was waiting for that to happen.) Dad&#x2019;s office<br>smells of pound notes, papery but metallic too. The blinds were down so<br>it felt like evening, not ten in the morning. There&#x2019;s a serious clock on the<br>wall, exactly the same make as the serious clocks on the walls at school.<br>There&#x2019;s a photo of Dad shaking hands with Craig Salt when Dad got made regional<br>sales director for Greenland. (Greenland the supermarket chain, not<br>Greenland the country.) Dad&#x2019;s IBM computer sits on the steel desk. <i>Thousands<br></i>of pounds, IBMs cost. The office phone&#x2019;s red like a nuclear hotline and<br>it&#x2019;s got buttons you push, not the dial you get on normal phones.<br>So anyway, I took a deep breath, picked up the receiver, and said our<br>number. I can say that without stammering, at least. Usually.<br>But the person on the other end didn&#x2019;t answer.<br>"Hello?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d;<br>They breathed in like they&#x2019;d cut themselves on paper.<br>&#x201c;Can you hear me?

Pale morning, icy sky, frosted crusts on the hills, but no sign of<br>sticking snow, worse luck. Dad&#x2019;s swivelly chair&#x2019;s a lot like the Millennium<br>Falcon&#x2019;s laser tower. I blasted away at the skyful of Russian MiGs streaming<br>over the Malverns. Soon tens of thousands of people between here and<br>Cardiff owed me their lives. The glebe was littered with mangled fusilages<br>and blackened wings. I&#x2019;d shoot the Soviet airmen with tranquilizer darts as<br>they pressed their ejector seats. Our marines&#x2019;ll mop them up. I&#x2019;d refuse all<br>medals. &#x201c;Thanks, but no thanks,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d tell Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan<br>when Mum invited them in, &#x201c;I was just doing my job.&#x201d;<br>Dad&#x2019;s got this fab pencil sharpener clamped to his desk.

Half the kids in the village&#x2019;re there, right now. <i>Ace </i>doss or what?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jason!&#x201d; Mum appeared from the kitchen. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re letting the cold in!<br>Either invite Dean in<i>side&#x2014;</i>hel<i>lo </i>Dean&#x2014;or shut the door.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Um . . . just going out for a bit, Mum.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;<i>Um . . . </i>where?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Just for some healthy fresh air.&#x201d;<br>That was a strategic mistake. &#x201c;What are you up to?&#x201d;<br>I wanted to say &#x201c;Nothing&#x201d; but Hangman decided not to let me. &#x201c;Why<br>would I be up to anything?&#x201d; I avoided her stare as I put on my navy duffel<br>coat.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your new black parka done to offend you, may I ask?&#x201d;<br>I still couldn&#x2019;t say &#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d; (Truth is, black means you fancy yourself as<br>a hard-knock. Adults can&#x2019;t be expected to understand.) &#x201c;My duffel&#x2019;s a bit<br>warmer, that&#x2019;s all. It&#x2019;s parky out.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Lunch is one o&#x2019;clock <i>sharp.</i>&#x201d; Mum went back to changing the Hoover<br>bag. &#x201c;Dad&#x2019;s coming home to eat. Put on a woolly hat or your head&#x2019;ll freeze.&#x201d;<br>Woolly hats&#x2019;re gay but I could stuff it in my pocket later.<br>&#x201c;Good-bye then, Mrs. Taylor,&#x201d; said Moron.<br>&#x201c;Good-bye, Dean,&#x201d; said Mum.<br>Mum&#x2019;s never liked Moron.<br><br>Moron&#x2019;s my height and he&#x2019;s okay but <i>Jesus </i>he pongs of gravy. Moron wears<br>ankle-flappers from charity shops and lives down Druggers End in a brick cottage<br>that pongs of gravy too. His real name&#x2019;s Dean Moran (rhymes with &#x201c;warren&#x201d;)<br>but our P.E. teacher Mr. Carver started calling him &#x201c;Moron&#x201d; in our first<br>week and it&#x2019;s stuck. I call him &#x201c;Dean&#x201d; if we&#x2019;re on our own but name&#x2019;s aren&#x2019;t<br>just names. Kids who&#x2019;re really popular get called by their first names, so Nick<br>Yew&#x2019;s always just &#x201c;Nick.&#x201d; Kids who&#x2019;re a bit popular like Gilbert Swinyard have<br>sort of respectful nicknames like &#x201c;Yardy.&#x201d; Next down are kids like me who call<br>each other by our surnames. Below us are kids with piss-take nicknames like<br>Moran Moron or Nicholas Briar, who&#x2019;s Knickerless Bra. It&#x2019;s all ranks, being a<br>boy, like the army. If I called Gilbert Swinyard just &#x201c;Swinyard,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d kick my<br>face in. Or if I called Moron &#x201c;Dean&#x201d; in front of everyone, it&#x2019;d damage my<br>own standing. So you&#x2019;ve got to watch out.<br>Girls don&#x2019;t do this so much, &#x2019;cept for Dawn Madden, who&#x2019;s a boy gone<br>wrong in some experiment. Girls don&#x2019;t scrap so much as boys either. (That said,<br>just before school broke up for Christmas, Dawn Madden and Andrea Bozard<br>started yelling &#x201c;Bitch!&#x201d; and &#x201c;Slag!&#x201d; in the bus queues after school. Punching<br>tits and pulling hair and everything, they were.) Wish I&#x2019;d been born a girl,<br>sometimes. They&#x2019;re generally loads more civilized. But if I ever admitted that<br>out loud I&#x2019;d get bumhole plummer scrawled on my locker. That happened to<br>Floyd Chaceley for admitting he liked Johann Sebastian Bach. Mind you, if<br>they knew Eliot Bolivar, who gets poems published in <i>Black Swan Green Parish<br>Magazine, </i>was <i>me, </i>they&#x2019;d gouge me to death behind the tennis courts with<br>blunt woodwork tools and spray the Sex Pistols logo on my gravestone.<br>So anyway, as Moron and I walked to the lake he told me about the<br>Scalectrix he&#x2019;d got for Christmas. On Boxing Day its transformer blew up and<br>nearly wiped out his entire family. &#x201c;Yeah, sure,&#x201d; I said. But Moron swore it on<br>his nan&#x2019;s grave. So I told him he should write to <i>That&#x2019;s Life </i>on BBC and get<br>Esther Rantzen to make the manufacturer pay compensation. Moron<br>thought that might be difficult &#x2019;cause his dad&#x2019;d bought it off a Brummie at<br>Tewkesbury Market on Christmas Eve. I didn&#x2019;t dare ask what a &#x201c;Brummie&#x201d;<br>was in case it&#x2019;s the same as &#x201c;bummer&#x201d; or &#x201c;bumboy,&#x201d; which means homo.<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;see what you mean.&#x201d; Moron asked me what I&#x2019;d got for Christmas.<br>I&#x2019;d actually got �13.50 in book tokens and a poster of Middle-earth, but<br>books&#x2019;re gay so I talked about the Game of Life, which I&#x2019;d got from Uncle<br>Brian and Aunt Alice. It&#x2019;s a board game you win by getting your little car to<br>the end of the road of life first, and with the most money. We crossed the<br>crossroads by the Black Swan and went into the woods. Wished I&#x2019;d rubbed<br>ointment into my lips &#x2019;cause they get chapped when it&#x2019;s this cold.<br>Soon we heard kids through the trees, shouting and screaming. &#x201c;Last one<br>to the lake&#x2019;s a <i>spaz</i>!&#x201d; yelled Moron, haring off before I was ready. Straight off<br>he tripped over a frozen tire rut, went flying, and landed on his arse. Trust<br>Moran. &#x201c;I think I might&#x2019;ve got a concussion,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Concussion&#x2019;s if you hit your head. Unless your brain&#x2019;s up your arse.&#x201d;<br>What a line.

Looking back over his shoulder, Jim saw the rebuilt Killahead Bridge. Even though the portal under it had already closed, he could still hear his teammates on the other side, calling out to him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jim!&#x201d; yelled Toby from the surface world.<br> <br>&#x201c;Master Jim!&#x201d; Blinky&#x2019;s voice carried into the Darklands. &#x201c;What have you done?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jim took a deep breath and kept walking, trying to ignore them. But the Trollhunter&#x2019;s next step faltered, when he heard one more distant voice.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jim, come back!&#x201d; cried Claire. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to do this by yourself! We can figure this out together!&#x201d;<br> <br>Jim wanted nothing more than to run back to the bridge, reopen the portal, and return to the warm safety of Heartstone Trollmarket. He wanted see Toby&#x2019;s braces-filled smile again. He wanted to fist-bump all four of Blinky&#x2019;s Troll hands. And more than anything, Jim wanted to look into Claire&#x2019;s eyes. He wanted to tell her that he was okay, that deep down all this was for her&#x2014;and her baby brother, Enrique, who had been stolen into the Darklands months ago.<br> <br>But the Trollhunter didn&#x2019;t do any of that. Jim forced himself to tune out Claire&#x2019;s plea. He marched farther across the Dead Plains, until he reached a cliff. Standing at the edge of the precipice, Jim looked out on the endless expanse of the Darklands. His disbelieving eyes beheld towering rock structures that intersected at odd angles, a low black sun that cast a sickly light over everything, and a mind-bending maze that seemed to stretch into infinity.<br> <br>The engravings in Jim&#x2019;s armor pulsed with red power. A split second later, the Sword of Eclipse appeared in the Trollhunter&#x2019;s hand. The black sword shimmered as Jim affixed it magnetically to his armored back.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get ready, Gunmar,&#x201d; Jim said out loud, even though he couldn&#x2019;t see a single sign of life anywhere around him.<br> <br>Jim knew that somewhere down there, in the twisted heart of the Darklands, Gunmar the Black waited for him. And that when they finally came face-to-face, only one of them would survive the encounter. But Jim couldn&#x2019;t worry about that just yet. Before he could take on Gunmar, the Trollhunter had to find someone else.<br> <br>Jim cupped his hands around his mouth and called out, &#x201c;Enrique!&#x201d;<br> <br>Even though he projected as loud as he could, Jim&#x2019;s voice hardly seemed to carry over the dead, flat air in the Darklands.<br> <br>&#x201c;Um, remember me?&#x201d; Jim continued. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your sister&#x2019;s favorite study buddy&#x2014;Jim! Just, uh, gurgle if you can hear me!&#x201d;<br> <br>Jim waited for a response, but none came.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course it wouldn&#x2019;t be that easy,&#x201d; Jim muttered to himself. &#x201c;Looks like I&#x2019;ve gone from being Trollhunter to Babyhunter.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jim took a step, then stopped. His brow furrowed as he thought about what he had just said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Um, that came out wrong. I mean, who actually hunts babies? Other than, y&#x2019;know, Gunmar and his Changelings. Maybe I should go by something a little more appealing, like . . . Babyfinder? Babyrescuer? Babysaver? Yeah, Babysaver. That&#x2019;s way more appropriate. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Jim trailed off, a sense of isolation starting to creep in before adding, &#x201c;Aaand I&#x2019;m already talking to myself less than five minutes into the Darklands. Way to keep it together, Lake. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>He looked over the edge of the cliff and wondered how he was going to climb down it. Jim suddenly found himself wishing he had bothered to pack a few supplies before jumping haphazardly through Killahead Bridge. He figured that stuff like a rope or compass or bottled water&#x2014;or, heck, even a meatloaf sandwich&#x2014;would&#x2019;ve been kinda helpful right about now.<br> <br>Maybe the Amulet could have guided Jim to a safer path, just as it had guided him ever since he found it months ago, in the Arcadia Oaks dry canal. Jim still couldn&#x2019;t believe how an Amulet created by Merlin&#x2014;yes, that Merlin&#x2014;had passed to Jim from the previous Trollhunter, Kanjigar, just as it had passed to Kanjigar from Deya centuries before that.<br> <br>But the Amulet wasn&#x2019;t of much use to Jim now. He had had to leave it back on the other side of Killahead Bridge. That was the only way to make sure the portal would reopen for Jim when he returned.<br> <br>If I return, Jim thought darkly.<br> <br>He looked down at the empty space over his heart where the Amulet usually ticked&#x2014;where it had unlocked new weapons for Jim, like the Eclipse Armor. Like the Sword of Eclipse. Like the . . .<br> <br>&#x201c;Glaives,&#x201d; Jim said to himself, getting an idea.<br> <br>He held his hands by his sides, and two curved blades&#x2014;the Glaives&#x2014;magically appeared in his palms. Using them like a pair of pickaxes, Jim lowered himself down the side of the cliff, like a mountain climber going in reverse. As he descended, Jim&#x2019;s mind couldn&#x2019;t help but wander. Each time he sunk a Glaive into the rock, another recent memory flooded into the Trollhunter&#x2019;s head.<br> <br>KA-SHUNK!<br> <br>Jim thought of the hurt looks on Claire&#x2019;s, Toby&#x2019;s, and Blinky&#x2019;s faces as he locked them out of the vault in Heartstone Trollmarket, which held the ruins of Killahead Bridge.<br> <br>KA-SHUNK!<br> <br>He remembered inserting the final Triumbric Stone&#x2014;a shard of Gunmar&#x2019;s missing eye&#x2014;into his Amulet and reading the incantation that then appeared across its surface: &#x201c;For the doom of Gunmar, Eclipse is mine to command!&#x201d;<br> <br>KA-SHUNK!<br> <br>Jim recalled how the Amulet then turned Jim&#x2019;s armor from silver to ebony before magically reassembling Killahead and opening the portal. Even now, Jim still felt that stomach-churning sensation from when he had stepped through the swirling passageway and into the Darklands.<br> <br>KA-SHUNK!<br> <br>He wondered what would happen when his mom, Barbara, woke up from the spell that made her forget Jim was the Trollhunter. Would Draal honor his oath to protect her? Could he even protect her? After all, Jim wasn&#x2019;t worried about another attack from enemies like Strickler or Angor Rot. He was more concerned about how his mom&#x2019;s heart would likely break when she discovered her only son had now gone missing.<br> <br>KA-SHUNK!<br> <br>The Trollhunter mourned AAARRRGGHH!!! The soft-spoken Krubera Troll had saved Jim countless times, just as he had aided Kanjigar and Deya before him. But AAARRRGGHH!!! gave his life to save his friends, and now the gentle giant&#x2019;s mossy body had been turned to solid stone. In AAARRRGGHH!!!, Jim and the others hadn&#x2019;t just lost a teammate. They&#x2019;d lost a friend.<br> <br>Jim pushed away all those painful thoughts as he finally reached the bottom. He stowed the Glaives back inside the onyx plates on his thighs and scanned the dim surroundings.<br> <br>That Changeling nursery has to be around here somewhere, Jim thought to himself. If I find the nursery, I find Enrique. And if I find Enrique, then I can find my way back home to Claire, Tobes, Blinky, Mom, and everyone else who doesn&#x2019;t want to murder me.<br> <br>Jim shook his head in another attempt to clear his friends&#x2019; faces from his brain. The Trollhunter had committed to taking on this mission alone. That was the only way to make sure those close to him would never be in danger again. Jim had just lost AAARRRGGHH!!! He wasn&#x2019;t about to lose someone else he loved.<br> <br>Turning a corner, Jim stepped into a clearing, and his blood froze. A Gumm-Gumm at his post stood before him, leaning against a wide ax that looked corroded from ages of neglect. Jim was about to reach for the Sword of Eclipse on his back when he noticed something. The Gumm-Gumm wasn&#x2019;t moving. He hadn&#x2019;t even reacted to Jim&#x2019;s presence. In fact, the Gumm-Gumm almost looked like he was . . .<br> <br>&#x201c;Asleep,&#x201d; Jim whispered to himself in relief.<br> <br>The Gumm-Gumm snored softly under his helmet. Jim tiptoed around the sentry, careful not to wake him. He had just crept behind the Gumm-Gumm&#x2019;s back, when another fierce wind blew across the Darklands. The gale loosened some gravel on a stone shelf over Jim&#x2019;s head. He watched with dread as the little bits of rock fell and clinked against the Gumm-Gumm&#x2019;s helmet.<br> <br>Rousing with a start, the Gumm-Gumm stood bolt upright and yelled, &#x201c;Who goes there?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jim cringed behind the guard&#x2019;s broad back, still unseen. Once again, he tried for his sword, but the metal plates on his armor tapped together as his arm moved.<br> <br>The Gumm-Gumm spun around and searched the space behind him. Fortunately, Jim jumped before the Gumm-Gumm could spot him, managing to stay behind his back. The Trollhunter timed his footfalls to land with the Gumm-Gumm&#x2019;s and kept out of his line of sight.<br> <br>&#x201c;If that&#x2019;s the Scorned or one of her rebels, come out to face me,&#x201d; the Gumm-Gumm growled. &#x201c;And the end of my ax!&#x201d;<br> <br>Jim didn&#x2019;t move a muscle. Hearing nothing else, the Gumm-Gumm huffed in satisfaction. He leaned against his battle-ax and dozed off once more.<br> <br>The second Jim heard the lazy lookout&#x2019;s snore return, he padded away as quickly&#x2014;and as quietly&#x2014;as he could. It was only after he was out of earshot that Jim remembered to breathe again. He exhaled visible clouds in the chilly air and shivered as he found himself in front of a labyrinth.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wonder if this Eclipse Armor could unlock a blanket for me,&#x201d; Jim joked to himself.<br> <br>All of a sudden, Jim felt warmth against his back. At first, he half believed that maybe the armor had given him a blanket. But when Jim turned around, he saw that the heat had nothing to do with him. It came, instead, from the large flying fireball that hurtled out of the darkness and toward Jim like a comet.<br> <br>&#x201c;WHO ARE YOU?&#x201d; demanded the fireball. &#x201c;WHO ARE YOU???&#x201d;<br> <br>Jim pulled the Sword of Eclipse off his back, held it in front of his body, and hoped like crazy that this new armor was fireproof. . . .</p><h2>Garden Craftsmanship in Yew and Box</h2><p>The planting and cultivation of yew and box has long been an important element in garden design. This popular reprint of Nathaniel Lloyd&#39;s classic work now benefits from the addition of some 48 colour plates and a stimulating introduction by the author&#39;s son Christopher. The first half of the book contains the text in which the author explains in plain, straightforward language precisely how to go about establishing a formal garden in yew or box. Brimming with common sense, advice and invaluable tips, it is a delight to read. Unlike so many other books on garden topics, the author does not merely explain what to do and then abandon the reader to get on with it. Here he goes on to explain, or discuss, in a continuous way, what progress he has made in his own gardening efforts over a period of years and what results we should reasonably expect from our own endeavours. The second half of this very practical book is devoted entirely to the author&#39;s own superb black and white photographs which provide pictorial examples and evidence of just what can be achieved. Now enhanced with additional colour plates, this book will prove invaluable to anyone contemplating formal garden design but will also attract the reader with only a casual or occasional interest in the subject.</p><p></p><h2>Chinese Cooking for Beginners</h2><p>Bilingual: English and Chinese.</p><p>Text: English, Spanish</p><h2>The Theology of St. Luke</h2><p>Book by Conzelmann, Hans</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Vagabonds of Gor</h2><p>To rescue the beseiged Ar, outcast warrior Tarl Cabot goes undercover as a spy within the enemy camp, disguised as a soldier of the Cosian army of invaders</p><p>John Norman, born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1931, is the creator of the Gorean Saga, the longest-running series of adventure novels in science fiction history. Starting in&nbsp;December 1966 with&nbsp;<i>Tarnsman of Gor</i>, the series was put on hold after its twenty-fifth installment,&nbsp;<i>Magicians of Gor</i>, in 1988, when DAW refused to publish its successor,&nbsp;<i>Witness of Gor</i>.

Nevertheless, Goethe believed that the theory derived from a fundamental error, in which an incidental result was mistaken for a elemental principle. Far from affecting a knowledge of physics, he maintained that such a background would inhibit understanding. The conclusions Goethe draws here rest entirely upon his personal observations.<br>This volume does not have to be studied to be appreciated. The author's subjective theory of colors permits him to speak persuasively of color harmony and aesthetics. These notions may evoke a positive response on their merits, but even among those who regard them as pure fantasy, the grace and style of Goethe's exposition provide abundant rewards. Although his scientific reasoning on this subject has long since been dismissed, modern readers continue to appreciate the beauty and sweep of Goethe's conjectures regarding the connection between color and philosophical ideas. In addition, he offers insights into early 19th-century beliefs and modes of thought as well as a taste of European life during the Enlightenment.</p><p>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832), a towering figure in German literature, was the author of <i>The Sorrows of Young Werther, Faust, Italian Journey, The Theory of Colours</i> (MIT Press edition, 1970), and many other works.<p>Can you lend me <i>The Theory of Colours</i> for a few weeks? It is an important work. His latest things are insipid.</p> (<b>Ludwig van Beethoven</b>, <i>Conversation-book</i>, 1820)</p><h2>Power to Save the World: The Truth About Nuclear Energy</h2><p>In this timely book, Gwyneth Cravens takes an informed and clarifying look at the myths, the fears, and the truth about nuclear energy.<br><br>With concerns about catastrophic global warming mounting, it is vital that we examine all our energy options. <i>Power to Save the World </i>describes the efforts of one determined woman, Gwyneth Cravens, initially a skeptic about nuclear power, as she spends nearly a decade immersing herself in the subject. She teams up with a leading expert in risk assessment and nuclear safety who is also a committed environmentalist to trace the path of uranium&#x2014;the source of nuclear fuel&#x2014;from start to finish. As we accompany them on visits to mines as well as to experimental reactor laboratories, fortress-like power plants, and remote waste sites normally off-limits to the public, we come to see that we already have a feasible way to address the causes of global warming on a large scale.<br><br>On the nuclear tour, Cravens converses with scientists from many disciplines, public health and counterterrorism experts, engineers, and researchers who study both the harmful and benign effects of radiation; she watches remote-controlled robotic manipulators unbolt a canister of spent uranium fuel inside a &#x201c;hot cell&#x201d; bathed in eerie orange light; observes the dark haze from fossil-fuel combustion obscuring once-pristine New Mexico skies and the leaky, rusted pipes and sooty puddles in a coal-fired plant; glimpses rainbows made by salt dust in the deep subterranean corridors of a working nuclear waste repository. <br><br>She refutes the major arguments against nuclear power one by one, making clear, for example, that a stroll through Grand Central Terminal exposes a person to more radiation than a walk of equal length through a uranium mine; that average background radiation around Chernobyl and in Hiroshima is lower than in Denver; that there are no &#x201c;cancer clusters&#x201d; near nuclear facilities; that terrorists could neither penetrate the security at an American nuclear plant nor make an atomic bomb from its fuel; that nuclear waste can be&#x2014;and already is&#x2014;safely stored; that wind and solar power, while important, can meet only a fraction of the demand for electricity; that a coal-fired plant releases more radiation than a nuclear plant and also emits deadly toxic waste that kills thousands of Americans a month; that in its fifty-year history American nuclear power has not caused a single death. And she demonstrates how, time and again, political fearmongering and misperceptions about risk have trumped science in the dialogue about the feasibility of nuclear energy.<br><br>In the end, we see how nuclear power has been successfully and economically harnessed here and around the globe to become the single largest displacer of greenhouse gases, and how its overall risks and benefits compare with those of other energy sources.<i><br></i><br><i>Power to Save the World </i>is an eloquent, convincing argument for nuclear power as a safe energy source and an essential deterrent to global warming.</p><p><b>Gwyneth Cravens on Why Going Green Means Going Nuclear</b> <p></p> "Most of us were taught that the goal of science is power over nature, as if science and power were one thing and nature quite another. Niels Bohr observed to the contrary that the more modest but relentless goal of science is, in his words, 'the gradual removal of prejudice.' By 'prejudice,' Bohr meant belief unsupported by evidence." <br> <i>--Pulitzer Prize-winner Richard Rhodes, author of the introduction to</i> Power to Save the World: The Truth About Nuclear Energy<i> by Gwyneth Cravens</i> <p></p> "Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less." <br> <i>--Marie Curie</i> <br><br> My book is fundamentally about prejudice based on wrong information. <p></p> <p></p>I used to oppose nuclear power, even though the Sierra Club supported it. By the mid-1970s the Sierra Club turned against nuclear power too. However, as we witness the catastrophic consequences of accelerated global temperature increase, prominent environmentalists as well as skeptics like me have started taking a fresh look at nuclear energy. A large percentage of the heat-trapping greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, that thaw Arctic ice and glaciers comes from making electricity, and we rely upon it every second of our lives. <p></p>There are three ways to provide large-scale electricity&#x2014;the kind that reliably meets the demands of our civilization around the clock. In the United States: <ul> <li>75% of that baseload electricity comes from power plants that burn fossil fuels, mainly coal, and emit carbon dioxide. Toxic waste from coal-fired plants kills 24,000 Americans annually. </li><li>5% comes from hydroelectric plants. </li><li>Less than 1% comes from wind and solar power. </li><li>20% comes from nuclear plants that use low-enriched uranium as fuel, burn nothing, and emit virtually no CO2. In 50 years of operation, they have caused no deaths to the public. </li></ul> <p></p>When I began my research eight years ago, I'd assumed that we had many choices in the way we made electricity. But we don't. Nuclear power is the only large-scale, environmentally-benign, time-tested technology currently available to provide clean electricity. Wind and solar power have a role to play, but since they&#x2019;re diffuse and intermittent, they can't provide baseload, and they always require some form of backup--usually from burning fossil fuels, which have a huge impact on public health. <p></p>My tour of the nuclear world began with a chance question I asked of Dr. D. Richard ("Rip") Anderson. He and his wife Marcia Fern�ndez work tirelessly to preserve open land, clean air, and the aquifer in the Rio Grande Valley. Rip, a skeptically-minded chemist, oceanographer, and expert on nuclear environmental health and safety, told me that the historical record shows that nuclear power is cleaner, safer, and more environmentally friendly than any other form of large-scale electricity production. I was surprised to learn that: <ul> <li>Nuclear power emits no gases because it does not burn anything; it provides 73% of America's clean-air electricity generation, using fuel that is tiny in volume but steadily provides an immense amount of energy. </li><li>Uranium is more energy-dense than any other fuel. If you got all of your electricity for your lifetime solely from nuclear power, your share of the waste would fit in a single soda can. If you got all your electricity from coal, your share would come to 146 tons: 69 tons of solid waste that would fit into six rail cars and 77 tons of carbon dioxide that would contribute to accelerated global warming. </li><li>A person living within 50 miles of a nuclear plant receives less radiation from it in a year than you get from eating one banana. Someone working in the U.S. Capitol Building is exposed to more radioactivity than a uranium miner. </li><li>Spent nuclear fuel is always shielded and isolated from the public. Annual waste from one typical reactor could fit in the bed of a standard pickup. The retired fuel from 50 years of U.S. reactor operation could fit in a single football field; it amounts to 77,000 tons. A large coal-fired plant produces ten times as much solid waste in one day, much of it hazardous to health. We discard 179,000 tons of batteries annually--they contain toxic heavy metals. </li><li>Nuclear power's carbon dioxide emissions throughout its life-cycle and while producing electricity are about the same as those of wind power. </li><li>Nuclear plants offer a clean alternative to fossil-fuel plants. In the U.S. 104 nuclear reactors annually prevent emissions of 682 million tons of CO2. Worldwide, over 400 power reactors reduce CO2 emissions by 2 billion metric tons a year. </li></ul> <p></p>I wanted to know if what Rip was telling me was true. He took me on a tour of the nuclear world so that I could learn firsthand its risks and benefits. I visited many facilities, talked to many scientists in different disciplines, and researched the conclusions of the National Academy of Sciences and various international scientific bodies. As I learned more, I became persuaded that the safety culture that prevails at U.S. nuclear plants and the laws of physics make them a safe and important tool for addressing global warming. Clearly many of my beliefs had originated in misinformation and fear-mongering. <p></p>I've now met many people dedicated to saving the environment while supporting nuclear power as well as other green resources. This path is only logical. Nuclear power is the only large-scale, non-greenhouse-gas emitting electricity source that can be considerably expanded while maintaining only a small environmental footprint. If as a society we're going to reduce those emissions, we'll need every resource to do so, and we'll have to set aside our ideological blinkers, look at the facts, and unite to meet the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced. <p></p>The power to change our world does not lie in rocks, rivers, wind, or sunlight. It lies within each of us. <p></p><i>--Gwyneth Cravens</i> <br><br> <br><br>Gwyneth Cravens has published five novels.

Close your eyes and feel it.&#x2026; </i> <br>THERE WAS NEVER A time when spirits didn&#x2019;t speak to me, walk across my bedroom at night, or whisper in my ear. They speak to you as well. You&#x2019;re just better able to dismiss it, more logically rooted in this physical world than I am&#x2014;even though I&#x2019;ve tried hard to ground myself in logical left-brain thinking. <br>Somewhere in my 1951 birthing, there was probably a vast undiscovered damage to my perfect brain&#x2014;so big and precise, it nearly diminished my left mind and left me mostly connected to the heavenly realms. <br>From early on, there were radiant beings who spoke to me in the flower garden where my mother planted daisies&#x2014;and departed saints who stood beside me every Sunday in church. It&#x2019;s a blessing I was Catholic; the Virgin Mary was a constant presence in my life, one so real that I spoke to her out loud. I prayed the rosary daily from the time I learned how. <br>The mysterious city of New Orleans made my gifts seem almost normal. My intuitive Creole mother, descended from a long line of psychic women, was strong enough to see what I needed and help me get firmly rooted here. She spent her afternoons teaching me letters, sounding out the words precisely and logically until I could develop my left brain and read the pages. I was only three years old. It saved me. She believed I was gifted. <br>When I grew older and would hear what someone was going to say before they said it, time fell backwards and I withdrew. I&#x2019;m sure I looked disturbed, troubled. I didn&#x2019;t understand the laughter and why they couldn&#x2019;t hear the whispers of those who stood around us. But I didn&#x2019;t like crazy. I was way too strong for that. <br>So I hit the dirt. Sprang into survival mode. I learned to think logically&#x2014;to follow from <i>A</i> to <i>B,</i> to ignore the visions and dreams. I didn&#x2019;t want to disappoint my kind and logical father. I needed a paycheck. And when the whispers began to fade, I found myself an early career at the age of twenty, teaching children to read and organize their left brains because that was what I needed. I became a Montessori preschool teacher to heal myself. <br>If I&#x2019;d only known all along I was here to explain the world as I saw it&#x2014;and not try to fit in or become like everyone else&#x2014;I could have gotten my work done sooner. I&#x2019;ve taken quite a while to get this message to you, to help you realize the veil is thin and that you came here on purpose with a mission. Yet this is the one thing I&#x2019;ve always been sure of, and the gift I came to share. <br>MY FATHER&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>It&#x2019;s May 1997. My dad, diagnosed with lung cancer four weeks earlier, has been in a coma for days, struggling for breath. My family takes turns caring for him at the hospital. I want to stay at his side today because I sense he&#x2019;s leaving. Yet it&#x2019;s my turn to babysit his five grandchildren&#x2014;including my three-year-old daughter. <br>I kiss my dad on the forehead, tell him I love him and will see him soon. Back at Grandmother&#x2019;s house, I put the kids down to nap. Finally they sleep. I&#x2019;m free to meditate, as I&#x2019;ve done every day for thirty years. <br>Sitting on the couch, I close my eyes and repeat a mantra&#x2014;an ancient Sanskrit sacred sound. Right away, my mind settles down. Instantly, my father is vividly in front of me, laughing and being goofy. He&#x2019;s young and healthy. I&#x2019;m delighted to see him happy and animated. This image is so real and tangible that I smile and say playfully, &#x201c;Dad, what are you doing here?&#x201d; <br> <i>&#x201c;Dad!&#x201d;</i> I repeat out loud, opening my eyes, realizing that I&#x2019;ve just clearly seen my dad who&#x2019;s in a hospital miles away&#x2014;dying. I pick up the phone to call the hospital room. My brother answers. <br>&#x201c;Jim, what&#x2019;s happening? I just saw Dad.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s had a heart attack. We&#x2019;re trying to stop the CPR efforts. It&#x2019;s chaos.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I was meditating and he appeared in front of me&#x2014;alive and happy.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s amazing, Sue. You&#x2019;re psychic,&#x201d; he says sweetly but sarcastically. &#x201c;Now, put the kids back in the car and come down here.&#x201d; <br>By the time I reach the hospital with my entourage of cranky toddlers, Dad&#x2019;s body is laid out peacefully on the hospital bed and my family is gathered around, crying. I&#x2019;m upset that I wasn&#x2019;t with him. <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s gone,&#x201d; Jim says as I enter. &#x201c;But you were with him more than we were. It was chaos here when it happened. You saw him as soon as he crossed over.&#x201d; <br>I&#x2019;m still upset that I wasn&#x2019;t at his side to help him. But eventually I realize that Dad&#x2019;s spirit wasn&#x2019;t caught up in the crazy chaos going on in the hospital room. He was with me, and he was clearly happy and free! I&#x2019;m grateful that I was sitting in meditation and able to see him so clearly. <br>Days later, as the family gathers in the living room to discuss funeral arrangements, my three-year-old daughter runs into the room and stops suddenly. &#x201c;Why is everyone crying?&#x201d; she asks, looking around at our sad faces. <br>&#x201c;Because Grandpa died and we miss him,&#x201d; says my brother Tom. <br>&#x201c;I just saw him fly past the window and he looked happy,&#x201d; she says with absolute innocence&#x2014;looking at us, confused, as if we&#x2019;ve got it wrong. <br>My brother kneels in front of her and says gently, &#x201c;Tell me what you saw, Sarah.&#x201d; <br>She describes my father looking young and happy&#x2014;flying past the window and waving to her. It makes us all smile to imagine it. We believe her. It helps us. <br>ANOTHER STORY&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>It&#x2019;s been a day that I&#x2019;ll have forever etched into my soul&#x2014;July 13, 1980&#x2014;the day my husband died. After his yearlong battle with colon cancer, Paul has slipped gracefully from his body, through my arms, and out to soar in the summer rain of a Colorado afternoon. <br>After weeks of exhausting medical traumas, I&#x2019;ve come home from the hospital to sleep in our bed, which now lives in the center of the living room. This bed is where we first shared love and dreams of the future&#x2014;and finally morphine drips and nasogastric canisters that marked the end of Paul&#x2019;s life. At age thirty-five, he&#x2019;s gone. <br>His death has given me a gift of unquestionable awareness that we&#x2019;re souls on a journey and that life continues beyond the physical realms. But still he&#x2019;s gone. I&#x2019;m widowed and alone at age twenty-nine. I already miss him. <br>Exhausted, I fall asleep in our bed and soon become aware that Paul is sleeping beside me. Of course he&#x2019;s here. He&#x2019;s my husband and I can feel his warm fuzzy legs wrapped around mine. I feel him embracing me tightly and feel his breath on my hair. I can&#x2019;t remember where he&#x2019;s been&#x2014;but he&#x2019;s home now. <br>After a while, a man dressed in white stands beside the bed. I think he must be a nurse. His long arm stretches over me to tap Paul. Slowly I realize he isn&#x2019;t wearing white and he isn&#x2019;t a nurse. He&#x2019;s emanating light. And he isn&#x2019;t human&#x2014;but something else. I&#x2019;m not sure what. As he reaches over me, Paul suddenly vanishes from beside me. <br>I open my eyes to see that it&#x2019;s 2 A.M., no one sleeps beside me, and no one stands beside the bed, dressed in white. I feel the unmistakable presence of a divine being. I realize Paul was here and a higher being came to move him on. His brief visit is over and his spirit guide is helping him move to the higher realms. <br>For several more nights, I&#x2019;m awakened suddenly out of deep sleep&#x2014;sensing a presence in the room. When I open my eyes, the clock reads the same time: 2 A.M. His visit is over. <br>A CLIENT&#x2019;S DEPARTED MOTHER SENDS A MESSAGE <br>It&#x2019;s 2011 and my eyes are closed in meditation as I prepare to work with a client by phone. I can hear a persistent female voice in my ear saying: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m watching over my girls, having tea with them. Having tea with my girls&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>My client&#x2019;s name is Marya and she&#x2019;s thirty-four years old. During the phone session, I learn she&#x2019;s struggling with depression and can&#x2019;t get her career headed in the right direction. She hates her job. <br>The other woman&#x2019;s voice is still persistent in my ear. I describe the voice and the message to my client. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my mother!&#x201d; says Marya. &#x201c;She died suddenly ten years ago in a car accident. I have one sister. We were &#x2018;Mom&#x2019;s girls.&#x2019; We had tea with her every day when we were little. When we were older, she&#x2019;d invite us over for tea and conversation.&#x201d; <br>I describe the persistent, almost obnoxious energy of this woman I heard speaking into my ear. &#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s my mom,&#x201d; she says. <br>Her mother&#x2019;s death marked a terrible turning point for Marya. She was twenty-four years old when it happened and never got over the sudden loss. It launched her into a major depression. &#x201c;Why did my mom die so horribly? I needed her,&#x201d; cries Marya. &#x201c;When it happened, I decided the world was a dark place and I didn&#x2019;t want to be here. Nothing made sense anymore.&#x201d; <br>As we talk, a ray of sunlight shines through my office window onto the wall across from me. The sunlight, dappled by the moving leaves outside my window, creates a distinct shadow on the wall. It&#x2019;s a perfect picture of a beautiful woman&#x2019;s face. I describe this face to Marya. It&#x2019;s her mom. <br>For the entire hour of our phone session, I stare at the perfect image of the woman&#x2019;s face on the wall. The face has never appeared before or since in my office. My client&#x2019;s mother was so determined that I give Marya a message that she manifested a distinct image of herself for me to see. <br>&#x201c;Your mother is still with you, watching over you,&#x201d; I tell Marya. &#x201c;You have to live like you know she&#x2019;s watching. Make her proud of you.&#x201d; <br>By the end of our session, Marya&#x2019;s voice is lighter. She agrees to take several baby steps toward doing her great work and fulfilling her soul&#x2019;s mission. <br>HOW OUR DREAMS CAN HEAL US <br>Many times when I&#x2019;ve been in pain, a departed loved one has come into my dreams to heal me. I first published this story about my friend Crissie in my book <i>I See Your Soul Mate,</i> and received so many e-mails from people telling me how the story helped them. I&#x2019;m putting it into this book too, in hopes it inspires you to connect with someone you&#x2019;ve lost. <br>I met my lifelong best girlfriend, Crissie, in second grade on the swing set of our Catholic elementary school playground. Her crazy brilliance and insane wit bonded us immediately. Our first conversation went something like this (although she was doing all the talking): &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think the word &#x2018;nunnery&#x2019; is weird, like a cannery? Why would a girl choose to be canned&nbsp;&#x2026; er&nbsp;&#x2026; nunned? Do you think nuns all come out the same from a nunnery like peas from a cannery? What if Shakespeare said, &#x2018;Get thee to a cannery!&#x2019;&#x201d; As she talked, she cracked herself up, bending over in peals of giggles that had me laughing uncontrollably along with her. I realized I had found a true friend&#x2014;someone who thought outside the box. I didn&#x2019;t always understand her, but I loved her instantly. <br>Years later, in seventh grade, the Beatles appeared on <i>Ed Sullivan.</i> Crissie and I were the only ones in our Catholic elementary school to have our lives changed at that moment. We knew the Beatles meant more than wonderful music and that they were showing us a bigger, more exciting life that we both wanted. We promised each other that we&#x2019;d get out of the South as soon as we graduated from high school and fulfill our huge dreams. She never let me forget that promise. <br>Her brilliance put her at the top of every class and got her accepted into Georgetown University in 1969 as one of a small group of the first women ever accepted to that prestigious college in Washington, D.C. When I told her I had been accepted into the University of Missouri to study journalism, she forever called it &#x201c;University of Misery&#x201d; and told me I should have &#x201c;aimed for a coast.&#x201d; (She was right! But I wasn&#x2019;t as smart as she was, so I was grateful for the chance to attend University of Misery.) <br>Our friendship lasted long beyond my stint at Misery and hers at Georgetown. Her first true love had been a fellow student at Georgetown University named Paul Frederick, to whom she became engaged. Two months before the big Southern wedding her parents had happily planned, Paul Frederick dumped her. Crissie never truly got over it. <br>Later when I moved to Colorado and met a handsome mountaineer named Paul Frederick (not the same guy), I was immediately leery of him. Would he break my heart too? (Turns out he did.) Crissie was the first friend to come visit us and meet my new love, whose name was the same as that of the man who broke her heart. She liked him right away. <br>When my Paul Frederick was diagnosed with cancer, Crissie&#x2019;s frequent phone calls helped me cope. With Crissie, every conversation was about exploring new ideas, asking tough questions, and searching for the truth&#x2014;all done in a gleefully witty way. I adored her. She asked me the toughest questions anyone ever did. And she made me laugh harder than anyone I knew. She always told me I was a gifted writer and should &#x201c;just write, dammit!&#x201d; <br>Six months after Paul died, Crissie came to visit. She cheered me up and challenged me simultaneously. What was I doing with my life now? Was I moving forward? Was I writing? She prodded and poked as we drove to the mountains to ski. She seemed healthy, energetic, lonely as usual, but generally happy with her California graduate student lifestyle. (She was getting a PhD in botany.) <br>On her flight back home to California, she noticed bruises appearing on her body. By the time she landed in San Francisco, she was covered in bruises and rushed by ambulance to the hospital. Her stunning leukemia diagnosis so soon after Paul&#x2019;s death was overwhelming. After this devastating news, I suffered several anxiety attacks where my throat would tighten up and I couldn&#x2019;t swallow or eat. I felt nauseated most of the time. <br>Crissie&#x2019;s mother moved to California to take care of her, and her father got her into the most advanced treatment of the time&#x2014;a bone marrow transplant at Fred Hutchinson Hospital in Seattle. Surrounded by friends and family, she went through chemo and radiation treatments and nearly died during the torturous bone marrow transplant. I couldn&#x2019;t understand why someone as bright, loving, and good as Crissie would have to go through such suffering&#x2014;as horrible as Paul&#x2019;s experience. In deep despair and grief, I sold my belongings and moved to Mexico to teach fitness at a resort. I needed healing and was dropping out of a world that made no sense anymore. <br>When Crissie was finally in remission, she moved back to California and resumed graduate school studies. But she was only thirty-one years old and had been through hell. She was in a deep spiritual crisis, wondering what the purpose of life was. I understood her pain. <br>We stayed in touch with letters and phone calls. She began getting her life going again and started to feel better.

Like all really original achievements it makes us sharply rethink things we supposed we knew well, but it does so with humour and humanity, and through the text runs Brewer's remarkable intellect: forceful, lucid and penetrating." </strong>- <em>Simon Schama</em></p> <p><strong>"<em>The Pleasures of the Imagination</em> is a splendid cornucopia of a book. It describes the contortions of the eighteenth century as it developed a culture... It is full of pure delight... The marvel of this book is that in writing in exuberant detail about the past, Brewer succeeds in illuminating the present... This book wears its massive scholarship lightly. I hope some of our new political masters have time to read it, for it is a history that teaches us many lessons." </strong>- <em>Peter Hall, The Observer</em></p> <p><strong>"Brewer ranges over almost every corner of the English mind with sharp, darting observation... Brewer is perceptive, amusing and thorough wherever he strays. This is by far the most complete and up-to-date account of the evolving Georgian arts... We are shown round a society aiming at Rome but often hitting Babylon, with the combined attitutes of fin-de siecle Paris and of Las Vegas. This is a book to treasure as it treasures a past we thought we had lost." </strong>- <em>Pat Rogers, Sunday Telegraph</em></p> <p><strong>"A model of the new cultural history... In Britons, Linda Colley highlighted the new political, patriotic and religious tides which flowed in the Georgian age, creating a fresh confidence and sense of national identity... <em>The Pleasures of the Imagination</em> confirms this view of the main of the public mind. It shows how the English came to feel not just strong but civilized too, polite as well as powerful. God's chosen people, of the age of Cromwell, were reinventing themselves as Shakespeare's heirs." </strong>- <em>Roy Porter, The Independent</em></p>In encyclopedic detail and with Johnsonian style and gusto, Brewer expatiates on the cultural development of a Public--reading, listening, and viewing--and the rise of Taste. Historian Brewer follows his work on the politics and government of the same period in Britain, The Sinews of Power (1989), with a reassessment of British culture as it moved out of the aristocratic Renaissance and rakish Restoration, and evolved into a culture driven in part by an extraordinarily mercantile middle class. Brewer demonstrates how London emerged as the center of a boom in literature, music, and art--admittedly from mercenary forces. Grub Street produced Pope and Johnson; the urban landscape inspired Hogarth and Rowlandson; Handel and Haydn found financial independence in oratorios and public concerts; and David Garrick combined the roles of actor-manager and neoclassical interpreter of Shakespeare. Brewer is equally interested in the consumers of this expanding culture. His glosses of the bookselling trade, the mercurial London theater, and art auctions and exhibitions are supported by firsthand accounts, such as those of Anna Larpent, an intellectual lady of leisure and taste, and Ozias Humphry, a miniaturist who never quite succeeded in the art business. With this refinement of taste, though, a cultural divide emerged between connoisseurs and dilettantes, amateurs and professionals, London and the provinces. Brewer, however, shows how the provinces not only absorbed culture from London but distributed it more evenly as well. Outside the home counties, he unearths lesser-known but interesting figures: Thomas Bewick, a successful Newcastle engraver; Anna Seward, the Lichfield bluestocking and contentious associate of Johnson; and John Marsh, a Chichester gentleman with a passion for amateur music. Only a book as rich, diverse, and allusive as Brewer's could do justice to the phenomenal cultural expansion of 18th-century England.

One of the most terrible items on her long list of fears is the horrid cousins her aunts never mention without shuddering. When her aunts are suddenly no longer able to care for her, Betsy is, incredibly, sent to live with those very relatives. Arriving in Vermont alone and full of trepidation, Betsy is immediately invited by her Uncle Henry to drive the carriage. Steering the fearful horses is just the beginning of her adventures in New England -- and independence. By the novel&#39;s end, Betsy has become very fond of the rough but affectionate relatives who eat in the kitchen and expect her to wash her own dishes. When she gets a letter from the aunts inviting her to come home, Betsy must make a difficult choice. Understood Betsy has been published in numerous editions worldwide since its 1917 debut, and continues to charm readers with its delightful and surprisingly liberated characters.</p><p>Anyone who fondly remembers how the fresh air of the moors puts a blush in the cheeks of sallow young Mary in <i>The Secret Garden</i> will love Dorothy Canfield Fisher's <i>Understood Betsy</i> just as much. First published in 1916, this engaging classic tells the tale of a thin, pale 9-year-old orphan named Elizabeth Ann who is whisked away from her city home and relocated to a Vermont farm where her cousins, the "dreaded Putneys," live. The Putneys are not as bad as her doting, high-strung Aunt Frances warns, however, and Elizabeth, who had been nurtured by her aunt like an overwatered sapling--positively blooms under their breezy, earthy care.<p> Elizabeth Ann's first victories are small ones--taking the reins from Uncle Harry, doing her own hair, making her own breakfast--but children will revel in the awakening independence and growing self-confidence of a girl who learns to think for herself... and even laugh. Along the way, "citified" readers of all ages will get a glimpse into the lives of people who are truly connected to the world around them--making butter ("We always bought ours," says Elizabeth Ann), experiencing the "rapt wonder that people in the past were really people," and understanding the difference between failing in school and failing at life. Fisher is a wise, personable storyteller, steeped in the Montessori principles of learning for its own sake, the value of process, and the importance of "indirect support" in child rearing. She also captures the tempestuous emotional life of a child as few authors can, crafting a story that children will find deeply satisfying. And in the end, readers will have grown as fond of the happier, stronger "Betsy" as the gentle, unassuming Putneys have.</p><p> Loving care was dolloped on this 1999 reissue of an old favorite--with sweet new pencil illustrations by Kimberly Bulcken Root, and an introduction and afterword by Eden Ross Lipson that offer a historical context for the book and its author.

Written for general readers rather than scholars and first published in 1938, The March of Literature is a working novelist&#39;s view of what is valuable in literature, and why. Convinced that scholars and teachers give a false sense of literature, Ford brings alive the pleasures of reading by writing about books he is passionate about. Beginning at the beginning - with ancient Egyptian and Chinese literature and the Bible - Ford works his way through classical literature, the writings of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, continuing up to the major writers of his own day like Ezra Pound, Henry James, and Joseph Conrad. With his encyclopedic reading and expertise in the techniques of writing, Ford is a reliable and entertaining guide. Ford also includes a chapter on publishers and booksellers, noting the key roles they play in literature&#39;s existence. Novelist Alexander Theroux (Darconville&#39;s Cat, An Adultery) has written an insightful introduction for this reissue, the first time this monumental book has been made available in paperback.</p><p>Ford Madox Ford was an English writer and critic, best known for his novel The Good Soldier, considered to be one of the greatest literary works of the 20th century; the Parade s End tetralogy, which was influenced by Ford s military service during the First World War; and The Fifth Queen trilogy, which chronicles the life of Henry VIII s ill-fated wife, Katherine Howard. As a critic, Ford championed new literature and literary experimentation, and his journals, The English Review and The Transatlantic Review, launched the careers of critically acclaimed authors like Thomas Hardy, Joseph Conrad, Henry James, D. H. Lawrence, and Ernest Hemingway. Ford died in 1939 at the age of 65."In substance it is so accurate and in style so exhilarating that one realizes that here is Mr. Ford's own book of literature, his own and easy command of it, and, while it commemorates his generation's memory, it ought to provide a new evocation for thousands of readers who are still alert and bound to read for themselves." -- <i>New York Times 10-9-38</i><br><br>"[The March of Literature] is stippled with sharp, knowing observations and phrases, worth remembering. . . . One of its particular strengths lies in the emphasis on earlier writing . . . and it should help inspire modern readers to go exploring in the literature of the past." -- <i>The Washington Post Book World 8-7-94</i><br><br>"[The March of Literature] reveals as much about Ford himself as the writers he portrays. Though it's a scholarly work that often soars with eloquence, the style is earnest and conversational. Ford had strong, quirky opinions and biases. . . .

Stephen King himself has said that he finds his early work "raw," and Brian De Palma's movie was so successful that we feel as if we have read the novel even if we never have. The simple answer is that this is a very scary story, one that works as well, if not better, on the page as it does on the screen. Carrie White, bullied by cruel teenagers at school and her religious nut of a mother at home, gradually discovers that she has telekinetic powers, powers that will eventually be turned on her tormentors. King has a way of getting under the skin of his readers by creating an utterly believable world that throbs with menace before finally exploding. He builds the tension in this early work by piecing together extracts from newspaper reports, journals, and scientific papers, as well as more traditional first- and third-person narrative in order to reveal what lurks beneath the surface of Chamberlain, Maine. <blockquote>News item from the Westover (ME) weekly Enterprise, August 19, 1966: "Rain of Stones Reported: It was reliably reported by several persons that a rain of stones fell from a clear blue sky on Carlin Street in the town of Chamberlain on August 17th."</blockquote> Although the supernatural pyrotechnics are handled with King's customary aplomb, it is the carefully drawn portrait of the little horrors of small towns, high schools, and adolescent sexuality that give this novel its power and assures its place in the King canon. <i>--Simon Leake</i>El escalofriante caso de una joven en apariencia insignificante que se transform� en un ser de poderes anormales, sembrando el terror en su ciudad.

Each writer brings to bear aspects of his or her own area of expertise&#x2014;be it cultural criticism, poetry, musicology or translation. Reflections tend to be personal and autobiographical, a tone set by Aciman in his preface when he charmingly writes of how Proust invites us to " 'bookmark' our own past onto his." Almost all of the contributors attempt to define Proustian sensibility and to register its effects on the life of the mind. Olivier Bernier discusses how reading Proust helped him to assert his own aesthetic values, and Wayne Koestenbaum acutely reflects on Proust's wisdom regarding love objects and the imagination. In a more informative mode, Edmund White discusses Proust's apparent homophobia and sexual identity; and Richard Howard analyzes the "coiling elaboration" of a classic Proustian sentence. This title is full of intriguing moments of appreciation, ripe for sampling by seasoned Proustians, but not intended as an introduction to the great author. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tacky is going to have to use all of his best penguin moves to get himself out of this hilarious jungle mix-up. Tacky&#39;s fans are sure to delight in the show.

While he is surfing, Tacky's brightly flowered shirt catches a gust of wind, and, after many days, he finds himself on a tropical island. There, he encounters a large gray rock that turns out to be an elephant. The elephant mistakes Tacky for a bouquet of blossoms just right for his table. To escape, Tacky must prove that he really is a bird by doing "something penguinish." He marches, dives, slides, and hops across the food-filled table with a bit too much vigor and ruins the elephant's tablecloth. The penguin's luck holds, however, and the elephant loves his colorful new tablecloth. With snacks and three kisses, Tacky returns home where he is welcomed as "an odd bird, a nice bird to have around." The story will appeal to children who know that making a mess can cause trouble.

Househunters, homeowners, realtors&#x2014;or anyone simply interested in what distinguishes a Victorian from a Colonial, what the difference is between Georgian and Greek Revival, or which empire inspired the Second Empire style&#x2014;will love this book. Morgan aims "to simplify&#x2014;in text, image and graphic presentation&#x2014;what has become a complex subject to understand," and his book largely succeeds. In 15 color-coded chapters, Morgan, whose writings on architecture have appeared in The Boston Globe, The New York Times, Smithsonian and other publications, demystifies American house styles, giving a two-page overview for each, photographic examples from around the country and notes on the style&#x2019;s defining characteristics. With its clear prose, comprehensive scope and excellent photos, this book will be a useful resource for all who care about American design.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Unimaginably rich, invariably swathed in a magnificent purple dressing-gown, Uncle oversees a vast ramshackle castle full of friendly kooks while struggling to fend off the sneak attacks of the incorrigible (and ridiculous) Badfort Crowd. Each Uncle story introduces a new character from Uncle&#x2019;s madcap world: Signor Guzman, careless keeper of the oil lakes; Noddy Ninety, an elderly train conductor and the oldest student of Dr. Lyre&#x2019;s Select School for Young Gentlemen; the proprietors of Cheapman&#x2019;s Store (where motorbikes are a halfpenny each) and Dearman&#x2019;s Store (where the price of an old milk jug goes up daily); along with many others. But for every delightful friend of Uncle, there is a foe who is no less deliriously wicked. Luckily the misbegotten schemes of the Badfort Crowd are no match for Uncle&#x2019;s superior wits. <br><br>Quentin Blake&#x2019;s quirky illustrations are the perfect complement to J.P. Martin&#x2019;s stories, each one of a perfect length for bedtime reading. Lovers of Roald Dahl and William Steig will rejoice in Uncle&#x2019;s wonderfully bizarre and happy world, where the good guys always come out on top, and once a year, everybody, good and bad, sits down together for an enormous Christmas feast.</p><p>&#x201c;A classic in the great English nonsense tradition&#x201d; -- <i>Observer</i><b>J.

Ferrell Prize for the Best Book on American Foreign Relations and the Virginia Ledbetter Prize for the Best Book on Southern Studies. He lives in Fayetteville, Arkansas.Lyndon Baines Johnson was a complex man who helped shape extraordinary times...Woods has created a full and well-balanced biography of an icon that manages to feel fresh...The LBJ of this book has more light than darkness--a contrary but deeply compassionate individual who was often two steps ahead of everyone else in the room, and who was undone by the times in which he lived. (Carol Iaciofano <i>Boston Globe</i> 2006-08-16)<br><br>Randall Woods has produced a magnificent portrait of Johnson that, while candid in showing the president's flaws, is [also] sympathetic. (Cary Clack <i>Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> 2006-09-17)<br><br>In little more than five years, Lyndon Baines Johnson probably did more to reform and repair American society than anyone else in history. Yet, instead of being memorialized as a hero, LBJ is more often remembered as a slimy manipulator whose good intentions were sunk in the quagmire of a needless war. But as <i>LBJ: Architect of American Ambition</i>, an outstanding new biography by Randall B. Woods, reminds us, the career and legacy of this extraordinarily complex Texan can hardly be summarized in a sentence...<i>LBJ</i> leaves us with a fuller picture of this 'accidental president' and a greater appreciation of him as a noble failure or--perhaps more accurately--a great man with some king-size flaws. (Randy Dotinga <i>Christian Science Monitor</i> 2006-08-01)<br><br>In his masterful new biography, Randall B. Woods convincingly makes the case for Johnson's greatness--as the last American president whose leadership achieved truly revolutionary breakthroughs in progressive domestic legislation, bringing changes that have improved the lives of most Americans. In this compelling, massive narrative, Woods portrays Johnson fairly and fully in all his complexity, with adequate attention to flaws in his character and his tragic miscalculations in Vietnam...In illuminating detail, Woods describes the enormous political skills with which Johnson, in quiet partnership with civil rights leaders, persuaded Congress to secure the basic freedoms of African Americans. Woods reminds us that dozens of government benefits and protections that Americans take for granted today were won in the 1960s principally because of LBJ's vision, legislative mastery and determination...Woods follows in the footsteps of LBJ's most reliable earlier biographers--Ronnie Dugger, Doris Kearns Goodwin and Robert Dallek--but makes his own unique contribution to the Johnson literature with a fresh, probing interpretation of the influences and ideals that shaped Johnson and his presidency...The book's strengths include a balanced narrative, graceful prose and Woods's nuanced understanding of Southern politics and culture. (Nick Kotz <i>Washington Post Book World</i> 2006-09-17)<br><br>In writing <i>LBJ: Architect of American Ambition</i>, Woods has produced an excellent biography that fully deserves a place alongside the best of the Johnson studies yet to appear. He is more sympathetic and nuanced than Caro, more fluid and (despite the significant length of his book) more concise than Dallek--and equally scrupulous in his use of archives and existing scholarship. Even readers familiar with the many other fine books on Johnson will learn a great deal from Woods. Unlike all but a few Johnson biographers, Woods is himself a Southerner, and has a particularly good understanding of the nexus of race, class, family and religion that shaped Johnson's life...Among Woods's many achievements in this fine biography is to allow us to see not only the enormous, tragic flaws in this extraordinary man, but also the greatness. (Alan Brinkley <i>New York Times Book Review</i> 2006-08-20)<br><br>Why...do we need another biography of Lyndon B. Johnson? The answer is that Johnson was so complex that every new biographer willing to do the tough spadework of original research discovers fresh layers of Johnsonian reality to explain, new psychological and political corridors to explore. Such is the case with this excellent new work by University of Arkansas historian Woods. Woods finds Johnson's key motivation to be largely altruistic, emerging from righteous outrage over the poverty and racism he'd witnessed while growing up in Texas. Woods serves up a Johnson who is less cynical, less self-serving and more heroic and tragic than the man portrayed elsewhere. Woods's Johnson is a man who saw his greatest personal ambitions realized with the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1964, and the Great Society programs. Not inappropriately, Woods concludes his eloquent and riveting account by quoting Ralph Ellison, who noted that Johnson, spurned at the end of his life by both liberals and conservatives, would 'have to settle for being recognized as the greatest American President for the poor and for the Negroes, but that, as I see it, is a very great honor indeed.' (<i>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</i> 2006-05-29)<br><br>Wood's single volume evenhandedly condenses the complexities and controversies associated with the thirty-sixth president of the U.S....Raised in the populist tradition, LBJ cut his political teeth as an all-out New Dealer. But he shrewdly knew that the ambitions he harbored for himself and American society would never be realized without placating conservatives of various kinds--economic, segregationist, or anticommunist. In this fact of Johnson's political life, which induced some to perceive him as a malodorous wheeler-dealer, Woods detects a remarkable consistency, an inwardly liberal LBJ whose outwardly moderate politics were an expression of his mastery of political calculus...Thorough, astute, and readable. (Gilbert Taylor <i>Booklist</i> 2006-08-01)<br><br>This is an absorbing portrait of a man who was as stand-and-deliver as his plain-speaking persona suggested but also a highly complex, driven individual who not only sought power but sought to do something with it.

A first novel. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>These days, Frank McCourt would seem to have cornered the market on lyrical depictions of Celtic poverty. But never fear, Sebastian Barry--the brilliant Irish playwright, poet, and prose-wrangler--is here. His new novel, <i>The Whereabouts of Eneas McNulty</i> recounts the odyssey of a small-town innocent, who grows up in circumstances more bucolic, but no less threadbare, than McCourt's. It's clear from the very first paragraph, however, that Barry means to take a wide-angle view of his Irish urchin: "In the middle of the lonesome town, at the back of John Street, in the third house from the end, there is a little room. For this small bracket in the long paragraph of the street's history, it belongs to Eneas McNulty. All about him the century has just begun, a century some of which he will endure, but none of which will belong to him." <p> Having handily survived his Sligo childhood, Eneas joins the British Army in time for World War I--and upon his return home, finds himself shunned as a collaborator. Tarred with this very Britannic brush, he goes one better and enlists in the Royal Irish Constabulary. Alas, this move only cements his fate as a marked man, and his father is soon issued a warning: "Let your son keep out of Sligo if he wants to keep his ability to walk." With a price on his head, Eneas commences a life of wandering, from Mexico to Africa to Nigeria (which the moonlight, he notices, "brings closer to Ireland.") From time to time he sneaks back to Sligo and is promptly expelled. </p><p> In another author's hands, this epic of dislocation could well be a bitter one. Yet the stoical and simple-minded Eneas is surprisingly free of anguish, and even his constant fear "has become something else, could he dare call it strength, a privacy anyhow." And the reader, at least, has the delightful distraction of Barry's prose, in which the occasional Joycean notes are entirely subsumed by the author's own colloquial brilliance. In the end, <i>The Whereabouts of Eneas McNulty</i> is less a novel than an exhibition of bardic fireworks--a latter-day <i>Aeniad</i> that's actually worthy of the name. <i>--James Marcus</i></p><p>Sebastian Barry was born in Dublin in 1955. His plays include <i>Boss Grady's Boys</i> (1988), <i>The Steward of Christendom</i> (1995), <i>Our Lady of Sligo</i> (1998), <i>The Pride of Parnell Street</i> (2007), and <i>Dallas Sweetman</i> (2008).

Now the vampires and the shapeshifters are &#39;out&#39;, you&#39;d think the supernaturals would get on with each other. But nothing is that simple in Bon Temps!</p><p><p></p><strong>A conversation with Charlaine Harris, best-selling author of Deadlocked, and Laurell K. Hamilton, best-selling author of Kiss the Dead</strong><p></p> <p><strong>Question: Did you ever imagine that your series would run as long as it has?</strong></p> <p><strong>Charlaine Harris:</strong> I was just glad to sell the first book. It took two years of my agent sending it out to get a bite. I never even dreamed that Sookie would be so popular, that I would find so much to say about her and her world.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Laurell K. Hamilton: </strong> No. I had over two hundred rejections for the first Anita Blake novel. They were the nicest rejections, with editors suggesting other publishing houses to send it to, but they, themselves, couldn't figure out how to market it. When I got that first three book contract, I remember thinking, "Well, at least I'll get to write three of them." I actually did think I had at least ten books in Anita and her world, but I don't think anyone can plan to write twenty-one novels in a series and still be excited about starting the twenty-second.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Did you ever dream paranormal would be this hot?</strong></p> <p><strong>LKH: </strong> I remember being told that mixed genre didn't sell, before the term paranormal became a genre. I was also told that no one wanted to read about vampires. More than one editor told me that particular monster was dead and gone. I thought there was life left in the old legends, but I never saw this level of popularity coming. </p><p> </p><p><strong>CH: </strong> Yes, even my agent didn't expect <i>Dead Until Dark</i> would be an easy sell, maybe especially since my books contained a lot of humor. Vampires were pass�, and books that crossed genres (Except for yours: I think you had three or four books out when I wrote the first Sookie, and I was so glad to discover them!) were called "unshelvable.&#x2019; I could never have anticipated shelves and shelves of cross-genre books. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Does fan response play a part in your planning process?</strong></p> <p><strong>CH: </strong> Not in the sense of changing plot direction in my novels. This is my story to tell, and I have to write it the way I see it. But every now and then when reader response to a character is unexpectedly enthusiastic--or the opposite--I'll take a second look at that character to see why he/she is coming across in a way I didn't expect or anticipate. </p><p> </p><p><strong>LKH: </strong> I don't change plot direction for fan reaction either. My story, my world, my books, my stuff, my way. The only people who can change the direction of my novels are my characters. It's their life, after all, so if they're really insistent on a different plot, then they win. I agree that reader response to a character can make me puzzle over them more, but it doesn't usually change how often the character is on stage, or how big their role is, because weirdly if the fans are interested, then I'm already intrigued. Best example is Edward who started out as this cold blooded assassin, almost a bad guy, and now he's one of Anita's best friends, and he's a U. S. Marshal. So, not what I had planned for him. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Have you ever had a character totally surprise you with their choices?</strong></p> <p><strong>LKH: </strong> A lot of my characters have minds of their own. Edward went away on his own and got himself engaged to a woman with two children from her first marriage. Edward-- assassin, ex-military, current police officer, taking a six-year-old to ballet lessons with all the other moms both amuses and hurts my head. Anita's love life went into a completely different direction than I'd ever anticipated. I so didn't see Anita dating this many men, or being in love with more than one man, and having everyone she loved okay with that. </p><p> </p><p><strong>CH: </strong> I've discovered some surprising things about my characters as I wrote them. I know that their minds are really my mind, but sometimes it doesn't feel that way. It's like knowing a character has a secret (I'm thinking of Bill), and then suddenly realizing what that secret is. I was genuinely aghast. Sometimes my creative brain thinks a lot faster than my conscious brain. And it's certainly a lot more devious. </p><p> </p><p><strong>How do you keep a world with paranormal elements credible?</strong></p> <p><strong>CH: </strong> I anchored my skewed world with real-life elements. Sookie has to pay her bills, she has to do her laundry, and she has family obligations. My vampires buy their clothes at the mall. My werewolf runs a surveying business. One of my fairies works in customer service at a department store. Readers seem to enjoy the fact that no matter what creature you may be, there's a process of surviving that has to be gone through; but there's all these other elements that make that process so different. </p><p> </p><p><strong>LKH: </strong> I make sure any real life facts are as real and well-researched as possible. Because I'm asking people to believe in vampires, wereanimals, and zombies, I need to make sure the guns, cars, and real crime are as realistic as possible. Once a reader catches me wrong in an area where they are expert they won't believe my monsters are real. But I have found if I'm right on the hard facts even experts will let me fudge, or take that next fantastic leap, because I've proven myself by laying the foundation of reality to make my leap into the unknown. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Do people ever expect you to be your characters?</strong></p> <p><strong>LKH: </strong> If I had known people would get confused between fiction and fact I'd have made Anita look less like me, but it just never occurred to me that there would be a problem. I've had fans want to know what weapons I'm carrying. They assume all the men are based on real people, and they aren't. I don't actually base characters on real people. Since I can't lighten Anita's hair, I've lightened my own and I get less fan confusion. I've had fans ask for the phone numbers of the men and get angry when I tried to explain I couldn't give them the contact info for a fictional character. </p><p> </p><p><strong>CH: </strong> Ha! Well, I'm much older and rounder than Sookie, so I'm definitely no stand-in for Sookie. In fact, readers who have never met me before are usually astonished when they meet me; so were the actors on <i>True Blood</i>. Some of my readers who came to me after watching <i>True Blood</i> get the characters in the books sort of conflated with the actors who play them on television. In their minds, Alexander Skarsgard IS Eric, Stephen Moyer IS Bill. It can lead to some confusing questions when I'm at signings. </p><p> </p><p><strong>What scenes in your novels are the most fun for you to write? Action? Sex? Relationship drama?</strong></p> <p><strong>CH: </strong> All of those are fun, depending on the outcome! But I have to say, I love to write a good fight scene. I find the "relationship" scenes a challenge. When people talk about their relationships, it's a messy conversation. People aren't too articulate about their innermost feelings. And such conversations don't proceed in a linear way, but jag back and forth as each speaker voices the issues that are most important to that person. So it's hard to make sound realistic, coherent, and yet condense such a conversation enough to make it tolerable. </p><p> </p><p><strong>LKH: </strong> It depends on my mood. Sometimes a good fight scene can be very therapeutic, and give a productive outlet for negative emotions. The more people involved in the action the more complex the fight choreography can become, and that can be a challenge, and slow down the emotional content for me. I enjoy doing sex scenes, but they are a different kind of challenge. On a day when I can get in the mood for the scene, they&#x2019;re great, but on a day when real life interferes, it&#x2019;s a bit like real sex. It&#x2019;s hard to concentrate on it when you have too many interruptions from the non-sexy side of your life. I guess that&#x2019;s true of all writing, though, too many interruptions disrupt the process in general. The biggest challenge for the sex scenes is that sex is a very personal and individual activity, so I have the same girl involved, but different men and I want each man&#x2019;s style to be unique. Relationship drama? Yuck, can I just say, yuck again? This kind of drama isn&#x2019;t fun in real life and the only thing that makes fictional relationship drama tolerable is that it&#x2019;s fictional, and I&#x2019;m not having to endure it in my real life, but other than that it sucks just as much. It also tends to complicate my life as a writer, because almost nothing screws up a story arc like relationship choices, though I have had action scenes go so differently from what I&#x2019;d planned that an entire third of a book had to be thrown out. It was a better book for it, but still, near deadline that was hard. </p><p> </p><p><strong>What&#x2019;s the hardest thing about writing such a long running series?</strong></p> <p><strong>LKH: </strong> The beginning of the book is easy, because you always want that to be interesting and lure in both old and new readers. It&#x2019;s the middle of the book that becomes more complicated. As a writer you always have to think that you may have brand new readers picking up your book, so you have to explain the characters, the world, everything, but you don&#x2019;t want to over explain to the long time readers. The other problem with a series is that each book needs to stand alone as much as possible, but you also want character growth and world development from novel to novel, so again, it&#x2019;s a balancing act. I make sure that each opening is different enough that you won&#x2019;t be left wondering, did I read that already. It&#x2019;s an issue I&#x2019;ve had with other series that I read. It gets very challenging when you get in double digits to make everything fresh, but familiar. I&#x2019;m lucky that I&#x2019;m still discovering new things about Anita, Jean-Claude, Edward, Nathaniel, everyone, and the world continues to grow and surprise me. My fictional world is like the real one, I never know quite what&#x2019;s coming next. </p><p> </p><p><strong>CH:</strong> The hardest thing is keeping track of previous developments and details. My memory just wasn't up to it, and I had to hire someone (the fabulous Victoria Koski). When you create a world, there are a thousand small things that make it credible, and it's easier than you'd think to forget whether someone is a werefox or a werelynx, or whether it's still daytime during the narrative or if you've passed into darkness. I think it's important to catch as many little errors as you can, so readers don't get yanked out of the world. I'm not the kind of reader who notices, but there are many readers who do.</p><p> </p><p>Photo Laurell K.

Her books include the bestselling <em>A History of God</em> and <em>The Battle for God</em>, as well as <em>Buddha</em> and <em>Islam: A Short History</em>. </p>In a meticulous quest for the historical Muhammad, Armstrong first traces the West's long history of hostility toward Islam, which it has stigmatized as a "religion of the sword." This sympathetic, engrossing biography portrays Muhammad (ca. 570-632) as a passionate, complex, fallible human being--a charismatic leader possessed of political as well as spiritual gifts, and a prophet whose monotheistic vision intuitively answered the deepest longings of his people. Armstrong ( The Gospel According to Woman ) refutes the Western image of Muhammad as an impostor who used religion as a means to power, an attitude encapsulated in a psychotic dream episode in Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses. Denying that Islam preaches total intransigence, she finds in the Prophet's teachings a theology of peace and tolerance. The "holy war" urged by the Koran, in Armstrong's reading, alludes to each Muslim's duty to fight for a just, decent society. She draws significant parallels between the spiritual aspirations of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Piloting and Seamanship 56/E</h2><p>Chapman carries on a tradition of authoritativeness, covering the latest developments in navigation, electronics, communications, and safety.

When her father dies unexpectedly, Serena discovers to her horror that she has been left a ward of Ivo Barrasford, marquis of Rotherham, a man whom Serena once jilted and who now has the power to give or withhold his consent to any marriage she might contemplate. With her father's heir eager to take over his inheritance--and Serena's lifelong home--she and her lovely young stepmother, Fanny, decide to move to Bath, where Serena makes an odd new friend and discovers an old love, Major Hector Kirkby. Before long, Serena, Fanny, Kirkby, and Rotherham are entangled in a welter of misunderstood emotions, mistaken engagements, and misdirected love. <p> Georgette Heyer's genius has always been in creating memorable characters, then placing them in a comedy of manners that is absolutely true to the Regency period. <i>Bath Tangle</i> is a delightful romp through the <i>haute ton</i> of early-19th-century England, and the battling, passionate, meant-for-each-other Ivo and Serena are one of her most successful romantic duos.</p>Georgette Heyer's novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades. English Heritage has awarded Georgette Heyer one of their prestigious Blue Plaques, designating her Wimbledon home as the residence of an important figure in British history. She was born in Wimbledon in August 1902. She wrote her first novel, The Black Moth, at the age of seventeen to amuse her convalescent brother; it was published in 1921 and became an instant success.<br><br>Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974. Her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously in 1975. A very private woman, she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or personal life. Her work included Regency romances, mysteries and historical fiction. Known as the Queen of Regency romance, Heyer was legendary for her research, historical accuracy and her extraordinary plots and characterizations. She was married to George Ronald Rougier, a barrister, and they had one son, Richard.</p><h2>On This Holy Night: The Heart of Christmas</h2><p><p><strong>Rekindle the true meaning of Christmas with the help of six gifted Christian communicators.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Every year, the story of Christmas is told and retold, but sometimes the very familiarity of holiday traditions causes us to overlook the vital expressions of this meaningful season.&nbsp;<em>On This Holy Night</em><em>&nbsp;</em>breathes new life into several aspects of the Christmas story through the voices of six beloved Christian communicators.

It will be one of the biggest movies of 2002, opening in the USA in January, followed by world-wide release. A big UK opening is now tentatively set for early March. For thirteen months the entire town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia was plagued by a dark terror that culminated in a major disaster. Unearthly noises and ghostly lights in the sky gave way to mutilated animals, winged monsters, weird flying machines and worst of all, the fearsomely demonic &#34;Bird&#34; - the Mothman.</p><p><p>JOHN A.

It was 3 A.M. on a cold, wet morning in late November 1967, and the little houses scattered along the dirt road winding through the hills of West Virginia were all dark. Some seemed unoccupied and in the final stages of decay. Others were un-painted, neglected, forlorn. The whole setting was like the opening scene of a Grade B horror film from the 1930s.<br>Along the road there came a stranger in a land where strangers were rare and suspect. He walked up to the door of a crumbling farmhouse and hammered. After a long moment a light blinked on somewhere in the house and a young woman appeared, drawing a cheap mail-order bathrobe tightly about her. She opened the door a crack and her sleep-swollen face winced with fear as she stared at the apparition on her doorstep. He was over six feet tall and dressed entirely in black. He wore a black suit, black tie, black hat, and black overcoat, with impractical black dress shoes covered with mud. His face, barely visible in the darkness, sported a neatly trimmed mustache and goatee. The flashes of lightning behind him added an eerie effect.<br>"May I use your phone?" He asked in a deep baritone, his voice lacking the familiar West Virginia accent. The girl gulped silently and backed away.<br>"My husband..." She mumbled. 'Talk to my husband."<br>She closed the door quickly and backed away into the darkness. Minutes passed. Then she returned accompanied by a rugged young man hastily buckling his trousers in place. He, too, turned pale at the sight of the stranger.<br>"We ain't got a phone here," he grunted through the crack in the door just before he slammed it. The couple retreated murmuring to themselves and the tall stranger faded into the night.<br>Beards were a very rare sight in West Virginia in 1967. Men in formal suits and ties were even rarer in those back hills of the Ohio valley. And bearded, black-garbed strangers on foot in the rain had never been seen there before.<br>In the days that followed the young couple told their friends about the apparition. Obviously, they concluded, he had been a fearful omen of some sort. Perhaps he had been the devil himself!<br>Three weeks later these two people were dead, among the victims of the worst tragedy ever to strike that section of West Virginia. They were driving across the Silver Bridge, which spanned the Ohio River, when it suddenly collapsed.<br>Their friends remembered. They remembered the story of the bearded stranger in the night. It had, indeed, been a sinister omen. One that confirmed their religious beliefs and superstitions. So a new legend was born. Beelzebub had visited West Virginia on the eve of a terrible tragedy.</p><h2>Stephen King Country: The Illustrated Guide to the Sites and Sights That Inspired the Modern Master of Horror</h2><p>Looks at the world in which author Stephen King lives and the real-life places that inspired the settings for some of his most popular works</p><p></p><h2>Before They Are Hanged [The First Law: Book Two] (The First Law, 2)</h2><p>&#34;Dark, deeply ironic, and full of character gems that will appeal to your cynical side, Before They Are Hanged is as brilliant as its predecessor.&#34;-SFRevu As war threatens to descend on all sides, the Kingdom of the Union-once glorious, now weak and corrupt-must depend for its security upon three very different men, unlikely saviors whose abilities and characters are shaky at best...and at worst, unknown.

Part one gives you all the background you need to understand Lean Six Sigma &#x2013; what it is, where it came from, what it has done for so many organizations and what it can do for you and your company. <br><br> Parts two and three of the book give you a prescribed yet flexible roadmap to follow in selecting, enacting and realizing improvements from Lean Six Sigma projects. Within this step-by-step structure, the authors demonstrate when and how to use the many Lean Six Sigma statistics and &#x201c;tools&#x201d; &#x2013; packing the pages with diagrams, real-life examples, templates, tips and advice. If you are a Green Belt or a Black Belt, or trainee, these two parts will be invaluable to you. <br><br> <i>The Complete Idiot&#x2019;s Guide to Lean Six Sigma</i> is the first book of its kind to integrate the Lean Six Sigma tools within a clear stepwise progression, so readers know when and how to actually apply them in their jobs. As such, this book is superior as a companion to any corporate or organizational Lean Six Sigma &#x201c;deployment.&#x201d; <br><br> <i><b>No more complex hodgepodge </b></i> <br><br> Other books about Lean and/or Six Sigma tend to provide a lot of good information, tools and statistics &#x2013; but mostly in a disconnected way, not in a way that is straightforward and user friendly. This makes an already complex subject seem still complex to the neophyte reader. On the other hand, the structure and progression of this book unfolds Lean Six Sigma in a way that a reader can easily become a user, and move more quickly from knowledge to application. <br><br> Therefore, using <i>The Complete Idiot&#x2019;s Guide to Lean Six Sigma</i>, you know why the statistics are important and where to use them, because this is made clear. You know how and when to use a Pareto Chart, or do a Stakeholder Analysis, or conduct a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). You not only get fully primed on all the parts and parcels of Lean Six Sigma, but you truly learn enough to become dangerous &#x2013; in a good way! In a way that makes you more valuable to your organization. <br><br> <i><b>Also for Lean Six Sigma leaders, not just practitioners</b></i> <br><br> Just as a Lean Six Sigma practitioner follows a proven formula for process improvement, a Lean Six Sigma Leader generally follows a process for achieving organizational transformation. This is why the&nbsp;final part of the book focuses on what a Lean Six Sigma leader or Champion needs to know and do to be successful &#x2013; again according to a detailed step-by-step process that can be followed exactly or modified to fit specific needs. <br><br> This includes:<br> � Identifying and selecting Lean Six Sigma projects.<br> � Understanding the process of organizational transformation.<br> � Installing an infrastructure for Lean Six Sigma deployment.<br> � Ensuring quantifiable performance gains are made and sustained. <br><br> Just like parts two and three show you how to implement a Lean Six Sigma project, part four of the book shows you the roadmap for implementing Lean Six Sigma on an organization-wide basis &#x2013; and embeds all the necessary management tools, templates, examples and aids you&#x2019;ll need within that progressive format. <br><br> <i>The Complete Idiot&#x2019;s Guide to Lean Six Sigma</i> is the smartest choice if you need a comprehensive primer, and especially if you need to actually improve a process or spread Lean Six Sigma capability throughout your company.

Today the lawn is one of America's leading "crops," outstripping cotton in acres by a factor of two. <i>American Green</i>, Ted Steinberg's witty expos� of this sometimes bizarre phenomenon, traces the history of the lawn from its explosion in the postwar suburban community of Levittown&#x2014;just miles from where Steinberg grew up&#x2014;to the present love affair with turf colorants, leaf blowers, and riding mowers. For half a century, Americans have been on a quest for the greenest, weed-free, ultra-trim turf imaginable. But perfection has its costs. Blending muckraking journalism and social history, Steinberg looks at both the lighter and the darker side of the all-American landscape, from mower accidents and pesticide poisonings to lawn-mower racing and the man so addicted to perfection that he re-created Augusta's 12th hole in his backyard. 40 illustrations.</p><p><b>Ted Steinberg</b> is an environmental historian at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. He is the author of four books, including <i>Down to Earth: Nature's Role in American History.</i>Apartment-dwelling urbanites may be surprised to learn how significant lawn care is to the American economy, generating more than $10 billion in annual sales of pesticides, fertilizers and other products. Steinberg, an environmental historian, is aiming for the grassy equivalent of <i>Fast Food Nation</i>, with one key difference&#x2014;while people know junk food isn't good for them, they may not be aware that most lawn care products are not only unnecessary but may actually harm soil and turf. He particularly damns the lawnmower industry, revealing how manufacturers "worked tirelessly to mislead the American public" for years in order to avoid the expense of installing safety features that could prevent severed fingers. Steinberg's subjects range from the postwar boom in suburban lawns to contemporary debates over noisy leaf blowers, and he mixes cultural history with personal lawn-related experiences in Long Island and Ohio, where some people maintain putting greens in their backyards. (Not surprisingly, Steinberg points out, golf courses are "the most intensively managed lawns in America.") There's plenty of muckraking outrage, but it's delivered in a friendly, engaging voice that might just win over skeptics. 40 illus. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

You've seen him on the street, in bars, on the subway, at restaurants: a twenty-something guy, nice suit, works in advertising. Regular. Ordinary. But when the ordinary person had to drinks, Augusten was circling the drain by having twelve; when the ordinary person went home at midnight, Augusten never went home at all. Loud, distracting ties, automated wake-up calls, and cologne on the tongue could only hide so much for so long. At the request (well, it wasn't really a request) of his employers, Augusten landed in rehab, where his dreams of group therapy with Robert Downey, Jr., are immediately dashed by the grim reality of fluorescent lighting and paper hospital slippers. But when Augusten is forced to examine himself, something actually starts to click, and that's when he finds himself in the worst trouble of all. Because when his thirty days are up, he has to return to his same drunken Manhattan life-and live it sober. What follows is a memoir that's as moving as it is funny, as heartbreaking as it is real. <i>Dry</i> is the story of love, loss, and Starbucks as a higher power.</p></p><p></p><h2>A Principal&#39;s Primer for Raising Reading Achievement</h2><p>Grade Levels: K-8 This book is a step-by-step manual for principals who are dissatisfied with their students&#39; reading achievement and who want to improve the overall reading performance of an elementary or middle school population.

When Aunt Dora comes from the East to teach him how to read, he sees no need to do so and refuses to cooperate with her. However, his aunt refuses to give up. She asks Noah to show her the land even though he warns her that her wheelchair may make it difficult to get around. As he wheels her along, she consults the book in her lap and begins to tell him about the natural things around them. Impressed by her knowledge, the child decides to learn to read and write, and realizes that his aunt has opened a world beyond the prairies to him. Warm, soft-edged illustrations capture the intimacy of the loving family relationships and the vastness of the landscape on dark, starlit nights and glorious, sky-blue days. A combination of double-page spreads, full-page, and half-page illustrations appealingly reinforce the mood and action of the text.

He was named a Grand Master in 1995 by the Mystery Writers of America.<br><br>One of a handful of novels he was working on at the time of his death, this fine, perhaps final, work from hard-boiled fiction icon Spillane (1918&#x2013;2006) was prepared for publication by Hard Case vet Max Allan Collins. In it, NYPD detective Jack Stang receives word that his old fiancee, Bettie, who supposedly died in a kidnapping-gone-wrong 20 years earlier, is still alive and residing in a small Florida coastal community. The good news is countered by the fact that, in the car crash that was supposed to have killed her, she lost her eyesight and all her memories. Even worse, the men who had her kidnapped in the first place have perfectly good memories and are still looking for her&#x2014;and willing to kill for the information locked in her damaged brain. This is a more sentimental Spillane than readers might expect, but the women are still dolls, the bad guys are still louses, and the hero still packs a helluva punch (along with his trusty .45, natch). Spillane always said he wrote for his fans, not for the critics, but both should be pleased with this late addition to the writer's canon. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Banks Over the last thirty years, M. John Harrison has been inspiring readers and writers alike across the world. His return to science fiction in 2002 with the magnificent space opera LIGHT was a monumental triumph, shortlisted for every major award in the genre. He combines brilliant storytelling with complex plots and evocative, mesmerising writing. THINGS THAT NEVER HAPPEN is M. John Harrison&#39;s definitive collection of short fiction, twenty-four dazzling stories of science fiction and fantasy; the perfect introduction to one of Britain&#39;s most brilliant writers.</p><p>M. John Harrison was born in the Peak District and now lives in London."In some places, we're all ghosts," Harrison writes in "The Incalling," one of 24 superlative stories in this British author's first U.S. collection. From the "warren of defeated streets" between Camden Rd. and St. Pancras in London to the "glacial moraines of Stake pass, where dragonflies clatter mournfully through the brittle reed-stems," Harrison writes ghost stories without any ghosts in them. His characters typically live in the margins, or have conspired to live there through the vagaries of fate or experience. They quiver on the edge of discovering a great truth, uncovering a vast secret about the universe, or living a life previously unknown to them. Such characters are often enraptured by a vision or obsession invisible to the rest of us. The painter's precision with which Harrison works and the aversion to cliche and generic detail make his prose style hyper-real even in his most fantastical tales. "The Egnaro," "The Great God Pan," "Isobel Avens Returns to Stepney in the Spring" and "The Neon Heart Murders" are particularly brilliant and compare favorably with the work of any fiction writer in the world, whether genre or mainstream. Wise, unflinching, precise, these stories immerse us in a world we thought we knew but that stands revealed by turns as richer, starker and more complex.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Bitter Blood: 2A True Story of Southern Family Pride, Madness, and Multiple Murder</h2><p>Shelf wear and some foxing to DJ and page edges. Text is clean. Binding is tight.</p><p>This book recreates a complex case that claimed nine lives, one of the more shocking crimes of recent years. The links in all the deaths were Susan Lynch and her cousin Fritz Klenner, each from a prominent, upper-middle-class Southern family. The murders began with the shootings of Lynch's ex-mother-in-law and ex--sister-in-law in Kentucky, and continued with the slayings of her parents and grandmother in North Carolina. What connected the killings was the bitter divorce between Susie and her husband Tom, and the impending custody battle for their children, particularly since it became increasingly clear that Susie regarded the boys as pawns in a power struggle. The deaths that she prepared for her two sons, and which inadvertently killed her and Klenner as well, provide a dramatic climax to this account of families too blind to realize that well-bred folk can be dangerous. Bledsoe wrote an award-winning series about the case in 1985 in the Greensboro (N.C.) News &amp; Record. Photos not seen by PW.

Thaw, and her infamous relationship with her murdered lover, famed architect Stanford White.</p><p>Paula Uruburu is the author of <em>American Eve: Evelyn Nesbit, Stanford White, The Birth of the "It" Girl, and the Crimeof the Century</em>. She isan associate professor of English at Hofstra University. An expert on Evelyn Nesbit and the time period in which sh elived, Uruburu has been widely published and has appeared on A&amp;E's <em>Biography </em>and PBS's <em>History Detectives </em>and <em>American Experience</em>, as well as been a consultant for the History Channel.&#x201c;Paula Uruburu serves up an intriguing and meticulously researched slice of American history. Evelyn Nesbit typified the glorious excesses of the Gilded Age, and this story has everything: sex, deception, drama, and a lurid love triangle, all culminating in the crime of the century.&#x201d;<br> --Karen Abbott, author of <i>Sin in the Second City: Madams, Ministers, Playboys, and the Battle for America's Soul</i><br><br> &#x201c;By centering her book on the ever-fascinating figure of Evelyn Nesbit&#x2014;the stunningly beautiful chorine whose sexual charisma still burns through the Victorian photographs that adorn the book&#x2014;Uruburu has produced not only a tour de force of historical crime writing and an illuminating social history but a rollicking piece of storytelling: a work that brings to life an entire glittering era while maintaining a breathless narrative pace.&#x201d;<br> --Harold Schecter, author of <i>The Devil's Gentleman: Privilege, Poison, and the Trial That Ushered in the Twentieth Century</i><br><br> &#x201c;Of all the famous beauties of a hundred years ago, Evelyn Nesbit is the only one who would still turn heads today. Paula Uruburu's triumph is to fix this very modern- looking girl in her proper time and place, and also to describe the New York of the early 1900s so vividly that we feel we, too, could be strolling towards the 21st Street apartment where the teen was seduced by Stanford White--or sitting in Madison Square Garden on the fatal evening that White was shot dead.&#x201d;<br> --Mike Dash, author of <i>Satan&#x2019;s Circus: Murder, Vice, Police Corruption, and New York&#x2019;s Trial of the Century</i><br><br> &#x201c;Paula Uruburu has given life to the tragic American story of the poor, beautiful nymph whose fate is so often entangled with extreme wealth and the powerful man. Evelyn Nesbit is like a Dreiser heroine&#x2014;Sister Carrie, Jenny Gerhardt&#x2014;though hers is a true story, harrowing in this writer's hands.&#x201d;<br> --Martha McPhee, author of <i>L&#x2019;America</i> and <i>Gorgeous Lies</i><br><br> &#x201c;In <i>American Eve</i>, a fascinating evocation of a woman and her times, Paula Uruburu does more than just tell the story of Evelyn Nesbit. Sex, money, scandal, celebrity, doom--the whole cocktail of America&#x2019;s obsessions is served up here in this intriguing, addictive book.&#x201d;<br> --Zachary Lazar, author of <i>Sway</i><br><br> &#x201c;Wonderfully absorbing . . . A lurid tabloid story of yore brought to fresh life and relevance with remarkable insight, verve and wisdom. Old New York is laid bare in all its decadence and the cult of pubescent beauty traced to its source, all with worldliness, wit, humor, compassion, and suspense. The result is a real page-turner.&#x201d;<br> --Philip Lopate, author of <i>Waterfront: A Walk Around Manhattan</i> and <i>Writing New York</i><br><br> &#x201c;Tragic now when a century ago it seemed merely scandalous, the story of Evelyn Nesbit is a gripping cautionary tale for those who believe Paris Hilton, Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan are the first of their kind. How is it that after a century of feminism, young beautiful women still crash and burn for an eager public? Using newly available family sources, Paula Uruburu tells Evelyn Nesbit&#x2019;s story in all its darkness and terror.&#x201d;<br> --Honor Moore, author of <i>The Bishop&#x2019;s Daughter</i><br><br> &#x201c;In <i>American Eve</i> a beautiful young woman, a lecherous prince of New York, and an unstable husband show us how the national sport of media-fed scandal began. Before the story ends, one man is dead, another is locked away, and Paula Uruburu has given us a look at an age of excess that looks remarkably like our own. It is page turning history at its best.&#x201d;<br> --Michael D&#x2019;Antonio, author of <i>Hershey: Milton S.

My very favorite book (and one that stands out in my mind--and with much affection--to this day) is Tunnel in the Sky. I really, really wanted to go off to explore new worlds with a covered wagon and horses, like the hero does at the very end of the book. But one of the nice things about Robert Heinlein is that he's got something for everyone. One of my best friends has a different favorite: Podkayne of Mars.

Now, in the aftermath of cold-blooded assassinations that have left her parents dead and the Vatta shipping empire shattered, Kylara faces her greatest challenge yet. <br><br>There is a time for grief and a time for revenge. This is decidedly the latter. Placing her cousin Stella in command of the trading vessel Gary Tobai, Ky embarks aboard the captured pirate ship Fair Kaleen on a twofold mission: to salvage the family business and to punish those responsible for the killings . . . before they strike again.<br><br>Since the network providing instantaneous communication between star systems has been sabotaged, news is hard to come by and available information impossible to trust. But as she travels from system to system, with Stella a step behind, Ky pieces together the clues and discovers a conspiracy of terrifying scope, breathtaking audacity, and utter ruthlessness.<br><br>The only hope the independent systems and merchants have against this powerful enemy is to band together. Unfortunately, because she commands a ship known to belong to a notorious pirate&#x2013;her own relative Osman Vatta, whom she killed for his part in her parents&#x2019; deaths&#x2013;Ky is met with suspicion, if not outright hostility. Rumors swirl about her intent, her very identity. Soon even Stella begins to question her cousin&#x2019;s decisions and her authority to make them.<br><br>Meanwhile, the conspiracy Ky hunts is hunting her in turn, with agents insinuated into every space station, every planetary government, every arm of the military, and every merchant house&#x2013;including her own. Before she can take the fight to the enemy, Kylara must survive a deadly minefield of deception and betrayal.</p><p>Elizabeth Moon is the author of many novels, including Marque and Reprisal, Trading in Danger, Nebula Award�winner The Speed of Dark, Against the Odds, Change of Command, and Remnant Population, a Hugo Award finalist.

Nothing to see . . . no, there it was, small to make that much noise . . . and then the sudden flood of data from the implant: not an aircraft, no one aboard, a weapon homing on the airfield&#x2019;s navigational beacon. Visual data blanked, overloaded by heat and light, auditory data an inchoate mass of noise, swiftly parsed into channels again, stored, analyzed: primary explosion, structural damage, secondary explosion, quick flicker of building plans, primary visual restored . . .<br><br> Ky Vatta jerked awake, heart pounding, breath coming in great gasps. She wasn&#x2019;t there, she was here, in the dark captain&#x2019;s cabin of Fair Kaleen, darkness pricked with the steady green telltales of major ship functions. All she could hear beyond her own pulse beating in her ears were the normal sounds of a ship in FTL flight. No explosions. No fires. No crashing bricks or shattering glass. No reverberative boom echoing off the hills minutes later.<br><br> &#x201c;Bedlight,&#x201d; she said to the room, and a soft glow rose behind her, illuminating tangled sheets and her shaking hands. She glared at her hands, willing them to stop. A deep breath. Another.<br><br> The chronometer informed her that it was mid-third-shift. She had been asleep two hours and fourteen minutes this time. She went into the bathroom and looked into the mirror: she looked every bit as bad as she felt. A shower might help. She had showered already; she had taken shower after shower, just as she had worked out hour after hour in the ship&#x2019;s gym, hoping to exhaust or relax herself into a full night&#x2019;s sleep.<br><br> She was the captain. She had to get over this.<br><br> This time she dialed the shower cold, and then, chilled, dressed quickly and headed out into the ship. She could always call it a midshift inspection. Her eyes burned. Her stomach cramped, and she headed first for the galley. Maybe hot soup . . .<br><br> In the galley, Rafe was ripping open one of the ration packs. &#x201c;Our dutiful captain,&#x201d; he said, without looking up. &#x201c;Midshift rounds again? Don&#x2019;t you trust us?&#x201d; His light ironic tone carried an acidic bite.<br><br> She did not need this. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that I don&#x2019;t trust the crew. I&#x2019;m still not sure of this ship.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Ah. As I&#x2019;m sure you recall, I&#x2019;m on third-shift duty right now, and this is my midshift meal. Do you want something?&#x201d;<br><br> She wanted sleep. Real sleep, uninterrupted by dreams or visions or whatever . . . &#x201c;The first snack you pick up,&#x201d; she said.<br><br> He reached into the cabinet without looking and pulled something out. &#x201c;Traditional Waskie Custard,&#x201d; he said, reading the label. &#x201c;The picture is an odd shade of yellow&#x2014;sure that&#x2019;s what you want?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll try it,&#x201d; Ky said. He had put his own meal in the oven; now he handed her a small sealed container and a spoon. She glanced at the garish label; it did look . . . unappetizing. Inside the seal was what looked like a plain egg custard. Ky dug the spoon into it. It should be soothing.<br><br> &#x201c;Excuse my mentioning it to the captain,&#x201d; Rafe said, sitting across from her at the table. &#x201c;But you look like someone slugged you in both eyes about ten minutes ago. I promise to perform all my duties impeccably if you&#x2019;ll go back to bed and look human in the morning.&#x201d;<br><br> Ky started to say something about duty, but she couldn&#x2019;t get the words out. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t sleep,&#x201d; she said instead.<br><br> &#x201c;Ah. Reliving the fight? It must&#x2019;ve been bad&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> That attempt at pop psych therapy almost made her laugh. Almost. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I had my post-manslaughter nightmare the second night. This is something else.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You could tell me,&#x201d; he said, his voice softening to a purr. When she didn&#x2019;t respond, he sat up and said, &#x201c;With the matter of the internal ansibles, you have enough on me that I wouldn&#x2019;t dare reveal any secrets of yours.&#x201d;<br><br> Maybe it was safe to talk to him; he had been ready to commit suicide rather than let outsiders know he had unknown technology, a personal instantaneous communicator, implanted in his head. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not . . . it&#x2019;s . . . I&#x2019;m not sure what it is.&#x201d; Ky tented her hands above the custard, which was not as soothing as she&#x2019;d hoped. Something in the texture almost sickened her. &#x201c;I think . . . somehow . . . I&#x2019;m seeing what happened back home.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What . . . the attack?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes. I know it&#x2019;s impossible; I don&#x2019;t even know if Dad&#x2019;s implant recorded any of it, and I haven&#x2019;t tried to access those dates anyway. But I keep dreaming it, or . . . or something.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;A high-level implant could record it all,&#x201d; Rafe said. &#x201c;If your father wanted a record, something for a court. Are you sure it&#x2019;s not bleeding over? I mean, if he put an Urgent-to-transmit command on it&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It couldn&#x2019;t override my priorities, could it? Everything&#x2019;s user-defined . . .&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;True, but this implant&#x2019;s had two users. It may not know you aren&#x2019;t your father.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s . . .&#x201d; Ridiculous, she had been going to say, but maybe it wasn&#x2019;t. She&#x2019;d had the implant inserted in an emergency, with no time then for adjustment of implant and brain. She&#x2019;d gone directly into combat, and then the direct connection to Rafe&#x2019;s implant had made changes in hers, changes that essentially reconfigured it into some kind of cranial ansible. That might have damaged or changed control functions. And she&#x2019;d never had someone else&#x2019;s implant before. Why, she wondered now, hadn&#x2019;t Aunt Grace downloaded the data into a new one? Unless it couldn&#x2019;t be done. &#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t thought of that,&#x201d; she said instead. &#x201c;What do you know about transferred implants?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not much,&#x201d; Rafe said. &#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s possible to use one; I don&#x2019;t know how much residual control might be involved. That one was your father&#x2019;s command implant, right? I&#x2019;d expect it to have special features.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It probably does,&#x201d; Ky said. &#x201c;It certainly does now, after linking with yours.&#x201d; She looked at the cup of custard and pushed it away. &#x201c;I suppose I&#x2019;d better look into that.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t want to go insane from lack of sleep and nightmares, that would be a yes,&#x201d; Rafe said, pulling his own mealpak from the microwave. &#x201c;Real food wouldn&#x2019;t hurt, either. How about some noodles and chicken? I can make myself another.&#x201d;<br><br> It smelled good. Ky nodded; Rafe pushed the tray across to her, picked up her container of uneaten custard and sniffed at it, then wrinkled his nose and dropped it in the recycler. He pulled out another mealpak and put that in the microwave before sitting down again. Ky took a bite of noodle and sauce; it went down easily.<br><br> &#x201c;See if the implant has a sleep cycle enabler,&#x201d; Rafe said. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t put those in kids&#x2019; implants, but the high-end adult ones often do, along with a timer. It should be in the personal adjustment menu somewhere.&#x201d;<br><br> Ky queried her implant and found it: sleep enhancement mode, maximum duration eight hours, monitored and &#x201c;regulated&#x201d; brain-wave activity and damped sensory input. Users were instructed not to use this function more than five sleep cycles in a row without medical advice . . .<br><br> An Urgent tag came up: &#x201c;Authorized user request: review sealed files.&#x201d; Ky scrolled mentally to check the priorities of sleep enhancement versus Urgent Message, dropped the priority of the message to allow sleep enhancement to override it, and set a condition for waking. Then she finished her noodles and chicken.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going back to bed,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Tell first shift I may be late.&#x201d;<br><br> Initiating sleep enhancement mode was like walking off a cliff into oblivion. She woke feeling rested for the first time since before she&#x2019;d put the implant in . . . languid, comfortable. After a shower and change, she went up to the bridge.<br><br> &#x201c;Good rest, Captain?&#x201d; Lee asked.<br><br> &#x201c;Very good,&#x201d; Ky said. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m going to need to spend a lot of time today exploring data stored in this implant. I suspect it&#x2019;s going to be very intense. So if there&#x2019;s anything you know you need for this shift, tell me now.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re doing fine,&#x201d; Lee said. &#x201c;All systems green&#x2014;this is a lovely ship, despite the way she&#x2019;s been used. Whatever else Osman was up to, he maintained the ship systems perfectly.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Call if you need me,&#x201d; Ky said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be in my cabin.&#x201d;<br><br> She puttered around briefly, stripping the bed and sending the linens through the &#x2019;fresher cycle, reluctant to face what was coming. When she realized that, she sat down at her desk and activated the secured files.<br><br> In the afternoon sky, the sound of the approaching aircraft rose above the sea breeze, a steady drone . . . but this time she was awake, and viewed the audiovisual data as an outsider, not a participant. Her father&#x2019;s emotions did not flood her awareness; she recognized the silhouettes of the two craft before the implant matched them.<br><br> Still, the violence of the explosions was shocking. Her breath came fast. Deliberately, Ky slowed the replay, returning again and again to the same image:...</p><h2>Mapplethorpe</h2><p>The definitive collection of nearly three hundred duotone photographs chronicles the development of Mapplethorpe&#39;s career, in a collection that includes his society portraits, nudes, floral still lifes, and explicit erotic images. 20,000 first printing. $100,000 ad/promo.</p><p>� A must-have for anyone interested in contemporary photography <p>� Includes the well-known and highly regarded essay by philosopher and art critic Arthur C.

Fighting for justice and treating even her enemies with firm compassion, Wonder Woman brought not a cape nor a ring nor a personal fortune or hidden clubhouse, but a magical lariat that compelled anyone it bound to tell the truth, and bracelets that could not only deflect bullets but prevent Wonder Woman from ever using her superpowers for unchecked destruction. <br> &nbsp;<br> The very first stories of the Amazon Warrior are collected here in WONDER WOMAN: THE GOLDEN AGE VOLUME 1, featuring the adventures of Wonder Woman as she tackles corruption, oppression and cruelty in ALL STAR COMICS #8, COMIC CAVALCADE #1, SENSATION COMICS #1-14 and WONDER WOMAN #1-3.</p><p>A noted psychologist and the man who perfected the testing system for the lie detector, William Moulton Marston was hired in 1941 as an advisor to All-American Comics publisher M.C. Gaines after he wrote an article praising the educational potential of comic books in the magazine The Family Circle. In December 1941, Wonder Woman&#39;s first adventure appeared in ALL STAR COMICS #8, written by Marston under the pen name Charles Moulton. For four years Marston wrote nearly all his creation&#39;s adventures, including both comic books and a syndicated newspaper strip. In 1945, suffering from the effects of a polio infection, he began to turn over the feature&#39;s scripting duties to others, particularly his assistant Joye Murchison. Marston died in 1947, just a week shy of his 54th birthday.</p><h2>History of Plymouth Plantation</h2><p>William Bradford&#x2019;s History of Plymouth Plantation is regarded as the most authoritative account of the Pilgrims and the early years of the colony they founded. Written between 1630 and 1651, the journal describes the story of the Pilgrims from 1608, when they settled in the Dutch Republic on the European mainland through the 1620 Mayflower voyage to the New World, until the year 1647. The book ends with a list, written in 1651, of Mayflower passengers and what happened to them. &#x2014; Wikipedia</p><p>William Bradford (1823-1892) was born and brought up in Fairhaven, Massachusetts. Bradford began his professional art career painting ship portraits. In 1861, he obtained financial backing for a journey to sketch and photograph the coast of Labrador. On this and subsequent voyages, he became fascinated with the special qualities of atmospheric light in northern regions. In 1869, Bradford made a notable expedition to the Arctic on the Panther leading to the original publication of The Arctic Regions.</p><h2>Shakespeare&#39;s Use of the Arts of Language</h2><p><p><b>Paul Dry Books' edition of this 1947 classic has been produced with the highest publishing standards as a companion to our edition of <i>The Trivium</i></b></p><p> Sister Miriam Joseph&#x2019;s <i>Shakespeare&#x2019;s Use of the Arts of Language</i> remains, after more than half a century, an immensely valuable aid to serious students of the greatest of all writers.

Hugh Thomas&#x2019;s magisterial narrative of Spain in the New World has all the characteristics of great historical literature: amazing discoveries, ambition, greed, religious fanaticism, court intrigue, and a battle for the soul of humankind.<br><br>Hugh Thomas shows Spain at the dawn of the sixteenth century as a world power on the brink of greatness. Her monarchs, Fernando and Isabel, had retaken Granada from Islam, thereby completing restoration of the entire Iberian peninsula to Catholic rule. Flush with success, they agreed to sponsor an obscure Genoese sailor&#x2019;s plan to sail west to the Indies, where, legend purported, gold and spices flowed as if they were rivers. For Spain and for the world, this decision to send Christopher Columbus west was epochal&#x2014;the dividing line between the medieval and the modern.<br><br>Spain&#x2019;s colonial adventures began inauspiciously: Columbus&#x2019;s meagerly funded expedition cost less than a Spanish princess&#x2019;s recent wedding. In spite of its small scale, it was a mission of astounding scope: to claim for Spain all the wealth of the Indies. The gold alone, thought Columbus, would fund a grand Crusade to reunite Christendom with its holy city, Jerusalem. <br><br>The lofty aspirations of the first explorers died hard, as the pursuit of wealth and glory competed with the pursuit of pious impulses. The adventurers from Spain were also, of course, curious about geographical mysteries, and they had a remarkable loyalty to their country. But rather than bridging earth and heaven, Spain&#x2019;s many conquests bore a bitter fruit. In their search for gold, Spaniards enslaved &#x201c;Indians&#x201d; from the Bahamas and the South American mainland. The eloquent protests of Bartolom� de las Casas, here much discussed, began almost immediately. Columbus and other Spanish explorers&#x2014;Cort�s, Ponce de Le�n, and Magellan among them&#x2014;created an empire for Spain of unsurpassed size and scope. But the door was soon open for other powers, enemies of Spain, to stake their claims.<br>Great men and women dominate these pages: cardinals and bishops, priors and sailors, landowners and warriors, princes and priests, noblemen and their determined wives.<br><br><b>Rivers of Gold</b> is a great story brilliantly told.

It was the autumn of 1491. Those who know the fertile plain, the vega, in which Granada stands, at that season of the year will recall the slight chill on the fine mornings, the blue sky at noon, and the sparkle from the high sierra to the south, with its near-perpetual snow.<br><br>Santa Fe had been constructed by soldiers, quickly, in eighty days, in the shape of a gridiron within a cross, four hundred paces long by three hundred broad. Coincidentally, and after Fernando's decision to build, a fire had destroyed the old Spanish camp nearby. The Queen had narrowly escaped being burned in her tent and had had to borrow clothes from a friend. Several villages had been razed by soldiers to provide material for the new town. But Santa Fe now had a mayor, a courtier who had been among the heroes of an earlier stage of the war against Granada: Francisco de Bobadilla, a comendador (commander) of the military Order of Calatrava, one of the semireligious brotherhoods that had played such a part in the Christian reconquest of Spain. Bobadilla was also maestresala (steward) of the monarchs and brother of the Queen's best friend, Beatriz de Bobadilla.3 There were now stables for a thousand horses. The intimation of permanence, combined with the speed with which Santa Fe had been built, constituted a good psychological weapon against the Muslims.<br><br>Santa Fe is still today a small, shining, white town. One can stand in the square before the church of Santa Mar�a de la Encarnaci�n, built in the sixteenth century, and gaze, in four directions, down whitewashed streets. Gates surmounted by chapels stand at the center of each of four old external walls, which, in their gleaming paint, seem at once new and immortal. Over the entrance to the church a lance has been sculpted, accompanying the words "�Ave Mar�a!," to recall a Christian knight, Hern�n P�rez de Pulgar, "he of the doughty deeds," who, one night the previous winter, had gone to Granada by a secret tunnel in order to pin, with his dagger, a parchment bearing those same words over the entrance to the main mosque.<br><br>Pulgar's action recalled that the conflict against the Muslims in which the Christians were engaged was for many a noble war in which men wanted to be seen to be brave. Most of the aristocracy of Spain had taken part, and many were competing not only for the conquest of the Muslim city, but also for fame.<br><br>Granada, 2,500 feet above sea level, is six miles to the east of Santa Fe. From the Spanish camp, the city looked to be a congeries of palaces and small houses, provided with water from the nearby Sierra Nevada by the two rivers, the Xenil and the Darro, which were said to wed, as well as meet, just short of the city. "What has Cairo to boast of, with her Nile, when Granada has her thousand Niles?" Muslim poets asked. From tall minarets, above mosques that the Christians believed would soon be converted into churches, the muezzin called the faithful to prayer; but the Spanish monarchs, eight years before, had obtained from the tolerant Genoese Pope, Innocent VIII, the right of patronage to all the churches and convents established in conquered territory. Spanish soldiers on reconnaissance could look into the besieged city: rest their eyes on the Arch of the Ears, and on the Plaza del Arenal, not to speak of the Bibarrambla, a quarter of artisans, and a densely built residential district, El Albaic�n.<br><br>The city was more like those of Muslim North Africa than of Christian Spain, as one or two experienced Spanish soldiers would have been able to recall. The beauty of Granada's blue tiles could not be seen from afar; nor could the Christians see such mottoes in Arabic as "Be not the indolent one" or "There is no conqueror but God," nor even "Blessed be He who gave to the Imam Mohammed a mansion which exceeds all others in beauty." But the rumor of the wealth in Granada was diffused in the Christian camp. Some Castilians thought that there was gold in the River Darro; while the more hardheaded Spanish commanders knew that Granada's principal product was silk, sometimes brought raw from Italy but usually deriving from the mulberries of the valley of the Alpujarras to the south, beyond the Sierra Nevada, and sold in many colors in the market of la alcaicer�a.<br><br>Higher up, there was the Moorish kings' lovely, rambling palace of the Alhambra, mostly built in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, much of the work performed by Christian slaves. Again, from the Spanish camp, one could not see the multitude of arches leading there from one magnificent room to another. But one could glimpse the strong towers and the wooden galleries that linked them. Higher still, at the end of a path bordered by myrtle and bay, there were the beautiful gardens of the Generalife, full of remarkable fruits, where splendid fountains flowed, or so the spies said.<br><br>In the town, the besiegers could observe too the strange apparel of a multitude of men and women in Muslim dress, since the latter, in burkas, appeared to be wearing shrouds, these covering not just their bodies but most of their faces. At night, they resembled ghosts. Here, too, were refugees who had fled from the Christians after earlier battles, from other cities, but also people who had refused to live as subject Muslims (mud�jares), under the peace terms offered in such places as Hu�scar, Zahara, Malaga, Alcal� de los Gazules, and Antequera.<br><br>At that time, only a few of their counterparts, Christians who had survived through the generations of Mohammedan rule, moz�rabes, lived in Granada; most of those who once had lived there had been deported, being perceived by the rulers as a potential military threat. There were some Jews in Granada, but their customs, like their food and official language, were largely Muslim. They fitted better into the life of the city than the Christians.<br><br>Granada was the capital of an emirate that had come into being in the thirteenth century, in the shadow of the fall of other Muslim monarchies in C�rdoba, Valencia, Ja�n, and Seville. The emirs were from a family, the Nasrids, which had emerged in the 1240s when a clever general from the little town of Arjona, in central Andalusia, seven miles south of And�jar, made himself a monarch, as Muhammad I. He made peace with the Christians, sent five hundred men to help King Fernando capture Seville, and paid a tribute to the Castilians. That relation continued indefinitely: Granada sent gold to Castile until 1480 in order to be allowed to continue her separate being, though whether that constituted what the Christians called "vassaldom" is open to argument.<br><br>The city under siege in 1491 was the last stronghold of a Muslim empire that had once stretched to the Pyrenees and beyond, and had included such northern Spanish lands as Galicia and, for a time, Asturias. Once the Muslim civilization in Spain had been rich, sophisticated, and scholarly, and Castilians, like other Christians, had learned much from it. But European civilization no longer looked to the Muslim world for inspiration. Instead, Granada had been chosen as a redoubt, both religious and military, by the Nasrids. Though its politics had been scandalous, murder and treachery being normal in the ruling family, its mullahs had been austere. Muslims elsewhere had been enjoined to flee there by their leaders: "By God, O Muslims, Granada has no equal, and there is nothing like service on the frontier during the Holy War. . . . Al-Andalus . . . where in the words of the Prophet, the living are happy and the dead are martyrs, is a city to which, as long as it endures, Christians will be led as prisoners. . . ."<br><br>Despite such advice, however, many Muslims lived in cities in Christian Spain in morer�as (Muslim ghettoes): 30,000, say, in Aragon, chiefly in the valley of the Ebro; perhaps 75,000 in Valencia; and 15,000 to 25,000 in Castile. Their condition was the same, whether they were the victims of recent conquests or whether their ancestors had surrendered to Christian Spain in the thirteenth century or even before. If the Christians captured a Muslim town after a battle, the citizens would be driven out; but when a city surrendered without a fight, they would often settle to become mud�jares. The latter decision seemed a danger for Islam. A Muslim lawyer wrote: "One has to beware of the pervasive effect of their [Christian] way of life, their language, their dress, their objectionable habits and their influence on people living with them over a long period of time, as has occurred in the case of the [Muslim] inhabitants of �vila and other places, for they have lost their Arabic and, when the Arabic language dies out, so does devotion." But then it was also contrary to Islamic law for a state to pay tribute to a Christian king, as Granada had done for most of her existence.<br><br>Christian practices varied. Navarre, an independent kingdom in the north, astride the Pyrenees, was particularly tolerant of Islam, the so...</p><h2>Massacre Mountain (Cotton Pickens Westerns)</h2><p>Cotton Pickens is feeling about as low as a man can get.

His translations of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em> and Julio Cortazar's <em>Hopscotch</em> have helped make these some of the most widely read and respected works in world literature.

In <em>If This Be Treason: Translation and Its Dyscontents</em> Rabassa offers a cool-headed and humorous defense of translation, laying out his views on the art of the craft. Anecdotal, and always illuminating, <em>If This Be Treason</em> traces Rabassa's career, from his boyhood on a New Hampshire farm, his school days "collecting" languages, the two-and-a-half years he spent overseas during WWII, his travels, until one day "I signed a contract to do my first translation of a long work [Cortazar's <em>Hopscotch</em>] for a commercial publisher." Rabassa concludes with his "rap sheet," a consideration of the various authors and the over 40 works he has translated. This long-awaited memoir is a joy to read, an instrumental guide to translating, and a look at the life of one of its great practitioners.</p><p>Gregory Rabassa was born in Yonkers, New York, March 9, 1922.

To make things still more conflicted and confused, the time Darryl McCarthy spends fighting alongside Cromwell forces him against his will to admire and respect&#x2014;and even like&#x2014;the man, despite Cromwell&#x2019;s demonic reputation among all self-respecting Irish nationalist families like Darryl&#x2019;s own.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s a Gordian knot anywhere you look&#x2014;until Julie Sims brings out her rifle.

Experienced author (<i>Making Metal Jewelry</i>, 2003, <i>Creative Metal Crafts</i>, 2004, among others) and artist Gollberg provides a broad foundation: first, warm-up data on metals, their properties, tools, and equipment; then, a series of chapters on progressively more difficult techniques from filing, carving, and tube riveting to flush stone setting and <i>kum boo</i> (the Korean art of bonding gold foil to another metal). Thirteen projects set the design bar high, as do the gallery pages that follow each chapter. Admittedly, it is a lot to digest at once.

Now, like Judy Blume (Summer Sisters) before her, Brashares turns her spectacular gifts to adult readers. In The Last Summer (of You and Me), Brashares uses her remarkable storytelling, emotional insights, and talent for capturing relationships to weave a rich, textured, mature novel that will resonate as clearly with readers in their forties as in their twenties.</p><p> Set on Long Island's Fire Island, <i>The Last Summer (of You and Me)</i> is an enchanting, heartrending page- turner about sisterhood, friendship, love, loss, and growing up. It is the story of a beach community friendship triangle-Riley and Alice, two sisters in their twenties, and Paul, the young man they've grown up with-and what happens one summer when budding love, sexual curiosity, a sudden serious illness, and a deep secret all collide, launching the friends into an adult world from which their summer haven can no longer protect them.</p><p> As wise, compelling, and endearing as her <i>Traveling Pants</i> series, and as lyrical, thoughtful, and moving as the best literary women's fiction, this novel is sure to win an entire new generation of adult fans.</p></p><p>In the town of Waterby on Fire Island, the rhythms and rituals of summer are sacrosanct: the ceremonial arrivals and departures by ferry; yacht club dinners with terrible food and breathtaking views; the virtual decree against shoes; and the generational parade of sandy, sun-bleached kids, running, swimming, squealing, and coming of age on the beach. <p>Set against this vivid backdrop, <i>The Last Summer (of You and Me)</i> is the enchanting, heartrending story of a beach-community friendship triangle among three young adults for whom summer and this place have meant everything. Sisters Riley and Alice, now in their twenties, have been returning to their parents' modest beach house every summer for their entire lives. Petite, tenacious Riley is a tomboy and a lifeguard, always ready for a midnight swim, a gale-force sail, or a barefoot sprint down the beach. Beautiful Alice is lithe, gentle, a reader and a thinker, and worshipful of her older sister. And every summer growing up, in the big house that overshadowed their humble one, there was Paul, a friend as important to both girls as the place itself, who has now finally returned to the island after three years away. But his return marks a season of tremendous change, and when a simmering attraction, a serious illness, and a deep secret all collide, the three friends are launched into an unfamiliar adult world, a world from which their summer haven can no longer protect them. </p><p>Ann Brashares has won millions of fans with her blockbuster series, <i>The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants</i>, in which she so powerfully captured the emotional complexities of female friendship and young love. With <i>The Last Summer (of You and Me)</i>, she moves on to introduce a new set of characters and adult relationships just as true, endearing, and unforgettable. With warmth, humor, and wisdom, Brashares makes us feel the excruciating joys and pangs of love-both platonic and romantic. She reminds us of the strength and sting of friendship, the great ache of loss, and the complicated weight of family loyalty. Thoughtful, lyrical, and tremendously moving, <i>The Last Summer (of You and Me)</i> is a deeply felt celebration of summer and nostalgia for youth.</p>Ann Brashares is the author of the phenomenal five-million-copies-selling series of young adult novels, <i>The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, The Second Summer of the Sisterhood, Girls In Pants</i>, and <i>Forever in Blue</i>, and the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling adult novel <i>The Last Summer (of You and Me)</i>.</p><h2>Eating Fire : Selected Poetry, 1965-95</h2><p>The evolution of Margaret Atwood&#39;s poetry illuminates one of our major literary talents. Here, as in her novels, is intensity combined with sardonic detachment, and in these early poems her genius for a level stare at the ordinary is wonderfully apparent. Just as startling is her ability to contrast the everyday with the terrifying: &#39;Each time I hit a key/ on my electric typewriter/ speaking of peaceful trees/ another village explodes.&#39; Her poetic voice is crystal clear, insistent, unmistakably her own. Through bus trips and postcards, wilderness and trivia, she reflects the passion and energy of a writer intensely engaged with her craft and the world. Two former collections, Poems 1965 - 1975 and Poems 1976 - 1986, are presented together with her latest collection, Morning in the Burned House, in this omnibus that represents the development of a major poet.</p><p>Margaret Atwood&#39;s novel, ALIAS GRACE, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize 1996.

Three months after the landing at Normandy, the Allies were finally within reach of the enemy on his home turf. Among the troops there was even talk of getting home for Christmas. What followed, though, was one of the most grueling campaigns of the war the nearly six-month-long battle fully recounted for the first time in this powerful work. Combining stirring narrative and meticulous historical detail, The Longest Battle provides a complete and compelling account of what happened after the first breach of the Third Reich by Allied ground combat forces: of the troops&#x2019; terrible struggle across the Siegfried Line, Hitler&#x2019;s vaunted West Wall, through the benighted Hurtgen Forest, and across the Roer. The strategic decisions and setbacks, the incremental advances, and catastrophic losses that marked this still-controversial but critically important battle unfold in all their historical, military, and human significance in Harry Yeide&#x2019;s book finally filling a gap in our understanding of World War II.</p><p><p><b>Harry Yeide</b> is an international affairs analyst with the federal government.

Together with Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko, and Richard Diebenkorn, Smith made his name at the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute) and from 1950 until the mid-1960s with successful exhibitions in Europe and on both coasts of the US. While his breakthrough paintings are characterized by their wildly vibrant brushstrokes and explosions of color, Smith was equally adept in a more restrained style, producing in later years the magisterial sequence of "measured" abstractions. As an initial burst of fame subsided, Smith continued to paint with unwavering energy. The result is a robust and dynamic body of work that reflects Smith&#x2019;s persistent curiosity and the breadth of his inquiry into the possibilities of painting. Long awaited by followers of the innovative art of the American Far West, this volume presents a full appreciation of Smith&#x2019;s achievement.</p><p>This book on the Abstract Expressionist painter Hassel Smith illustrates all periods of the artist&#39;s many-faceted career.Petra Giloy-Hirtz, former Associate Professor for Literature, has curated numerous international exhibitions.

No wonder 14-year-old Georgia Nicolson laments, "Honestly, what is the point?" A Bridget Jones for the younger set, Georgia records the momentous events of her life--and they are all momentous--in her diary, which serves as a truly hilarious account of what it means to be a modern girl on the cusp of womanhood. No matter that her particular story takes place in England, the account of her experiences rings true across the ocean (and besides, "Georgia's Glossary" swiftly eradicates any language barriers). <p> The author, Louise Rennison, is a British comedy writer and it shows. Whether Georgia is dealing with wearing a bra ("OK, it's a bit on the loose side and does ride up round my neck if I run for the bus"), pondering kissing and how to know which way to turn your head ("You don't want to be bobbing around like pigeons for hours"), or managing the results of an overzealous eyebrow-plucking episode ("Obviously, now I have to stay in forever"), she always cracks us up. Georgia struggles with the myriad issues facing teen girls--boys, of course being at the forefront--but she does it with such humor and honesty it almost seems like a good time. This refreshingly funny book is ripe for a sequel, which readers will await in droves.

What was intended as a brief sojourn turned into a far longer and far more intriguing residency across the seasons. The Yeadons made a home here in the ancient and alluring hill village of Aliano where Carlo Levi, author of the world&#x2013;renowned book Christ Stopped at Eboli, was imprisoned by Mussolini during part of World War II for anti&#x2013;fascist activities. </p><p> They became immersed in today's rich tapestry of people, lifeways, traditions, festivals, the rituals and rhythms of the grape and olive harvests, unique culinary delights, and other enticing peculiarities of place. At the same time, they discovered that much of the pagan strangeness Carlo Levi and other notable authors revealed here, still lurks beneath the beguiling surface of Basilicata. Evocative illustrations and richly colorful, often humorous tales of life in their hill village form the framework for Seasons in Basilicata.</p><p> Described by one reviewer as "one of our best travel writers," David Yeadon has shifted focus in this book to a far more intimate portrait of a single uniquely intriguing place. Tim Cahill found Yeadon "a very congenial travelling companion," Jan Morris praised his books as "full of strange, moving and entertaining experiences," and Kirkus celebrated them as "big, vigorous and hugely entertaining." </p><p> </p></p><p><p>David Yeadon is the author of <em>Seasons in Basilicata</em> and the bestselling <em>National Geographic Guide to the World's Secret Places</em>. He has written, illustrated, and designed more than twenty books about traveling around the world. He lives with his wife, Anne, in Mohegan Lake, New York.</p>Intrigued by Carlo Levi's book on life in the Italian province of Basilicata, <i>Christ Stopped at Eboli</i>, the author and his wife, Anne, decided to live for a year in Aliano, the village where Levi was kept under house arrest by Mussolini for seven months in 1935&#x2013;1936. In Levi's day, Basilicata, situated in the instep of Italy's "boot," was a place of poverty. Unlike Levi, however, British travel writer Yeadon (<i>The World's Secret Places</i>) was there to "live happily with Anne, learning, and generally have a spanking good time dining on all those gorgeous porky products and homemade olive oil and wines and wild game and pasta galore." In his entertaining book, he describes how he did just that, renting an apartment with a terrace overlooking the village square, making friends who enjoyed serving him sumptuous meals, learning how wine and olive oil are made and investigating the local superstitions. He tries to find out from the older inhabitants what life was like in the 1930s, but they are reluctant to talk about it, claiming that they are better off than they were. But Yeadon doesn't dig too deeply: finding it hard to reconcile his experiences with Levi's bleak portrayal of conditions in Basilicata, Yeadon concentrates instead on the comradeship and good food.

To Christians, love of it is the root of all evil. To generals, it&#39;s the sinews of war. To revolutionaries, it&#39;s the chains of labour. But in The Ascent of Money, Niall Ferguson shows that finance is in fact the foundation of human progress. What&#39;s more, he reveals financial history as the essential back-story behind all history. The evolution of credit and debt was as important as any technological innovation in the rise of civilization, from ancient Babylon to the silver mines of Bolivia. Banks provided the material basis for the splendours of the Italian Renaissance, while the bond market was the decisive factor in conflicts from the Seven Years&#39; War to the American Civil War. With the clarity and verve for which he is famed, Niall Ferguson explains why the origins of the French Revolution lie in a stock market bubble caused by a convicted Scots murderer. He shows how financial failure turned Argentina from the world&#39;s sixth richest country into an inflation-ridden basket case - and how a financial revolution is propelling the world&#39;s most populous country from poverty to power in a single generation. Yet the most important lesson of the financial history is that sooner or later every bubble bursts - sooner or later the bearish sellers outnumber the bullish buyers - sooner or later greed flips into fear. And that&#39;s why, whether you&#39;re scraping by or rolling in it, there&#39;s never been a better time to understand the ascent of money.</p><p>Niall Ferguson is one of the world's most renowned historians. He is the author of <i>Paper and Iron, The House of Rothschild, The Pity of War, The Cash Nexus, Empire, Colossus, The War of the World, The Ascent of Money, High Financier, Civilization, The Great Degeneration, Kissinger, 1923-1968: The Idealist, </i>and<i> The Square and the Tower</i>. He is Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, and a Visiting Professor at Tsinghua University, Beijing. His many awards include the Benjamin Franklin Prize for Public Service (2010), the Hayek Prize for Lifetime Achievement (2012) and the Ludwig Erhard Prize for Economic Journalism (2013).Who knew there was a financial subtext to MARY POPPINS? Niall Ferguson--apparently--who explains that the children&#39;s classic makes the important point about banking that a bank&#39;s success is based on a fragile faith. And it&#39;s that same faith--in coins, in paper, and now in virtual banking--that lets us believe that money exists even though we don&#39;t much see it anymore. Written before the current downturn, yet seeming to predict it, the book explains that the popping sound you hear is when the &#34;belief bubble&#34; bursts (and Ferguson profiles some massive bubble makers). Narrator Simon Prebble moves along this metaphysical history of dinero with command, authority, and a BBC accent. His tone and timing add an element of class to the project. It&#39;s sort of like sitting in on a really fab Oxford lecture. R.W.S.

Indeed, while Michael Stirling, dubbed the Merry Rake, is charming enough, subdued Francesca Bridgerton rarely seems worthy of his pursuit. All is well at the novel&#39;s outset, aside from the fact that Michael covets his cousin, the Earl of Kilmartin&#39;s, wife. Then, barely two chapters into the book, his cousin suffers an aneurysm and dies. Devastated and unable to cope with his new position as earl and his feelings for Francesca, Michael flees to India for four years, only to return still very much in love and suffering from malaria. In London, the two attend social events, trade quips and try to restore their friendship, but the more intimate they become, the more their feelings of guilt gnaw at them. Guilt is the only thing that stands in the way of the couple&#39;s happiness, and it&#39;s often frustrating to witness their slow, overwrought progression from denial to acceptance. While this book possesses some of the qualities that Quinn&#39;s fans have come to expect-sprightly prose, feverish love scenes and well-developed secondary characters-it is weighed down by the sheer intensity of the protagonists&#39; grief.

Mitch Rozier is an oversized, Montana-born, divorced, fiftysomething environmental columnist for a once-hip weekly newspaper on the verge of going under. Lexa McCaskill is his scrappy, earthy, no-nonsense "spousal equivalent"--a "compact Stetsoned woman in blue jeans," also from Montana and divorced, who makes a handsome living catering swanky parties for Seattle's software plutocrats. Doig has a fine time satirizing the excesses and absurdities of "Cyberia" before he abruptly shoos his characters back to Montana: Lyle Rozier, Mitch's Stegner-esque father, wants to involve his son in one more ransack-the-land scheme before leukemia kills him. <p> The wary standoff between father and son works on many levels: as a deeply realistic clash between two fierce, disappointed men; as a symbolic confrontation between the Old West and the new--Lyle's frank, freewheeling exploitation of Montana's vastness versus Mitch's helpless reverence for the environment; and as a brief, brilliant history of how people have lived off and with the land in 20th-century Montana. All of these strands come together in a stunning climax played out against the glorious backdrop of the Bob Marshall Wilderness. </p><p> One of the great novelists of the American West, Doig proves here that he is just as adept at conjuring up the vagaries of our shiny new cities as he is at taking the measure of rough, tough, old Montana. <i>Mountain Time</i> has everything going for it--great characters, breathtaking scenery, heartbreaking family feuds, wicked humor, a page-turning love story, prose so perfectly pitched you'll want to read it out loud. And there's something new for Doig aside from setting--a serene, twinkling levity.

The editors distinguish between grilling (which uses fast, direct heat) and BBQ (slow, indirect heat); weigh in on the virtues and shortcomings of gas and charcoal grilling; and address other puzzling grill-related issues. They warn readers that grilling and barbecuing are fraught with potential problems, and the book, while well researched, tends toward the negative (e.g., "If you slice meat straight from the grill, say goodbye to its juicy flavor.... There's nothing you can do now, but next time take this precaution"). Yet this approach is ideal for those who are nervous about outdoor cooking and want to know what to expect.

His second book, Where There's Smoke, celebrates the great tradition of grilling and entertaining outdoors.In this debut cookbook, Seaver, creator of three Washington, D.C., restaurants and a fellow with the Blue Ocean Institute, offers a passionate guide to sustainable seafood. He discusses essential ingredients in preparation such as salting (brining figures in his techniques), butter, and citrus, and gives a solid rundown of the particular tools for a fish kitchen, a helpful glossary of terms like &#34;trawling&#34; and &#34;by catch,&#34; and a list of the best substitutions for overfished species. Organized by season, the recipes reflect available fish as well as the mood of the time of year. Pacific cod with ginger-braised asparagus, for example, is a spring dish, and mahi mahi with braised brussels sprouts and feta butter makes an appearance in fall. While Seaver&#39;s cooking style is self-described as &#34;simple,&#34; his flavor combinations are anything but. An oyster risotto is cleverly enriched with butternut squash and cr�me fraiche, and grilled sablefish is brightened up with shredded endive and a cherry-tarragon salsa. Throughout, Seaver emphasizes sustainable, underrated species of fish; inventive preparations like crudo with almond oil and raisins, for instance, make mackerel more enticing.

But do we really understand it? In <i>This Land Is Our Land</i>, the renowned author Suketu Mehta attacks the issue head-on. Drawing on his own experience as an Indian-born teenager growing up in New York City and on years of reporting around the world, Mehta subjects the worldwide anti-immigrant backlash to withering scrutiny. As he explains, the West is being destroyed not by immigrants but by the fear of immigrants. Mehta juxtaposes the phony narratives of populist ideologues with the ordinary heroism of laborers, nannies, and others, from Dubai to Queens, and explains why more people are on the move today than ever before. As civil strife and climate change reshape large parts of the planet, it is little surprise that borders have become so porous. But Mehta also stresses the destructive legacies of colonialism and global inequality on large swaths of the world: When today&#x2019;s immigrants are asked, &#x201c;Why are you here?&#x201d; they can justly respond, &#x201c;We are here because you were there.&#x201d; And now that they are here, as Mehta demonstrates, immigrants bring great benefits, enabling countries and communities to flourish. Impassioned, rigorous, and richly stocked with memorable stories and characters, <i>This Land Is Our Land</i> is a timely and necessary intervention, and a literary polemic of the highest order.</p></p><p><b>Suketu Mehta </b>is the author of <i>Maximum City: Bombay </i><i>Lost and Found</i>, which was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, and won the Kiriyama Prize and the Hutch Crossword Award. His work has been published in <i>The </i><i>New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine, National </i><i>Geographic, Granta, Harper&#x2019;s, Time</i>, and <i>GQ</i>. He has won a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Whiting Writers&#x2019; Award, and an O. Henry Prize. He was born in Calcutta and lives in New York City, where he is an associate professor of journalism at New York University.<p>"A meticulously researched and deeply felt corrective to the public narrative of who today&#x2019;s migrants are, why they are coming, and what economic and historical forces have propelled them from their homes into faraway lands . . . <i>This Land Is Our Land</i> reads like an impassioned survey course on migration, laying bare the origins of mass migration in searing clarity . . . well argued, cathartic and abundantly sourced." <b>&#x2015;Lauren Markham, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b></p><p>"There are many mic-drop moments and eminently quotable lines . . .

The huge worldwide shifts of the twenty-first century&#x2015;which have a long history but seem quite new, thanks to the immediacy and visibility of the internet&#x2015;are impossible for many people to comprehend. Mehta fills in the blanks. He tells a bloody, traumatic story, and one no Western reader will feel proud of, though there can also be a strange comfort in understanding the logic of the present. History might be the best weapon against fear." <b>&#x2015;Suzy Hansen, <i>Bookforum</i></b></p><p>"Suketu Mehta&#x2019;s <i>This Land is Our Land</i> begins with an anecdote about his grandfather &#x2013; an immigrant well-versed in Britain&#x2019;s colonial experiments &#x2013; who, when confronted in London in the &#x2018;80s by a fellow Briton asking 'Why are you in my country?' responds: 'Because we are the creditors. You took all our wealth. Now we have come to collect.' It&#x2019;s the thesis of the book but just the barest hint of the argument that Mehta will marshal by the time he&#x2019;s finished presenting his sweeping history of how solidly our world has been built by immigrants." <b>&#x2015;</b><b>Ramtin Arablouei, NPR</b></p><p>&#x201c;Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;finalist Mehta (<i>The Secret Life of Cities</i>) displays his flair for evocative storytelling in this passionate argument for migration . . .

From 6,000 years ago until quite recently, North America was home to some of the most highly advanced and well organized civilizations in the world - complete with cities, roads, and commerce. From the lost city of Balbantsha, near New Orleans, to the Great Hopewell Road, a causeway for religious pilgrims along the Ohio River in the thirteenth century, these cultures built hundreds of thousands of structures, of which a small but tantalizing portion still remain. Like the Druids of Salisbury Plain, they patterned extraordinarily precise geometry according to the rising and setting of the moon. Like the ancient Egyptians, they organized millions of hours of human labor to construct pyramids, platforms, and plazas. In Hidden Cities, Roger G. Kennedy sets out on a bold quest of recovery - a recovery of the rich heritage of the North American peoples, and a reimagination of the true relations of their modern-day successors and neighbors.<br>From the Spanish and French explorers to the present, very few Euro-Americans have paid attention to the evidence and meaning of this heritage. Building on recent work of many archaeologists and historians, Roger Kennedy presents a fascinating picture of these American antiquities as well as their reception among leading citizens of the young United States. On missions of exploration, politics, and even piracy, men such as George Rogers Clark, George Washington, Albert Gallatin, and Thomas Jefferson frequently chanced upon the architecture of the past. As Kennedy shows us the magnificence of the mound-building cultures through the sometimes-prejudiced eyes of the Founding generation, he reveals not only the astounding history of our continent, but also the reasons why we have refused to credit Native American predecessors with the greatness they deserve.</p><p>Roger G. Kennedy is the director of the National Park Service and is the former director of the American History Museum at the Smithsonian Institution.Kennedy, director of the National Park Service, does better in exposing the prejudices of whites who came across the monuments of prehistoric America than in elucidating the mysteries embodied in these New World Stonehenges. An estimated 30 million Native Americans died of European or African diseases during the century following the conquistadors' appearance in the Western Hemisphere. They left behind significant traces of sophisticated cities, roads, and burial grounds in Memphis, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and elsewhere in the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys. Later explorers and soldiers beheld these relics--which included bits of antiquities, earthen mounds and various geometrical shapes carved into the landscape--with wonder, confusion, and obtuseness. Kennedy (Rediscovering America, 1990, etc.) perceptively analyzes how attempts to preserve and interpret Native American arts and architecture often foundered on the ingrained prejudices of even supposedly enlightened whites. (Thomas Jefferson, for example, was slow to shed his belief that Indians were incapable of architectural achievement.) Jeffersonians and Jacksonians found it easier to deprive Native Americans of land if they could deny that the Indians had a culture worth saving. They failed to follow the lead of such respectful figures as Jefferson's Treasury secretary, Albert Gallatin, described by Kennedy as "the first American statesman to employ the evidence of ancient American architecture to justify exertions to redeem the Republic from racial prejudice." The American mania for development, combined with dismissive scholarship that credited Indian achievements to fair-skinned "Welshmen" who supposedly discovered North America in the Middle Ages, led to a cavalier attitude toward Native American artifacts. By 1948, 90% of the earthen Indian architecture noted in a Smithsonian report 100 years earlier had been lost. Best read as an exploration of colliding cultures rather than an examination of the riddles left behind by Native American builders. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Now the fugitive settlers of Jijo--both human and alien--brace for a final confrontation. The Jijoans' only hope is the Earthship Streaker, crewed by uplifted dolphins and commanded by an untested human.<br><br>Yet more than just the fate of Jijo hangs in the balance. For Streaker carries a cargo of ancient artifacts that may unlock the secret of those who first brought intelligent life to the Galaxies. Many believe a dire prophecy has come to pass: an age of terrifying changes that could end Galactic civilization.<br><br>As dozens of white dwarf stars stand ready to explode, the survival of sentient life in the universe rests on the most improbable dream of all--that age-old antagonists of different races can at last recognize the unity of all consciousness.</p><p><i>Heaven's Reach</i> is the final volume of the Uplift trilogy, which begins in <i>Brightness Reef</i> and continues in <i>Infinity's Shore</i>. It chronicles the adventures of a handful of primitives from the planet Jijo who have left or been taken from their homes only to be swept into the intrigues of galactic politics. The novel also continues the story of the fugitive Earth starship <i>Streaker</i>, pursued across the galaxy for its precious cargo of ancient artifacts. Just when it looks like things can't get worse for <i>Streaker</i>, the foretold Time of Changes rocks the galaxy. Devastating "space quakes" shake every planet and star, and some of the particularly unscrupulous alien races attempt to use the disaster to further their bizarre goals. There's danger and excitement on almost every page (in contrast to much of the first two books in the series) and Brin finally delivers on many of the mysteries of the Five Galaxies. The Progenitors, the Hydrogen Breathers, <i>Streaker</i>'s cargo--these and more are explained at last. Or are they? Each seemingly ultimate truth tends to dissolve a chapter later, revealing a new and more complex truth. New adventures and mysteries await. <i>--Brooks Peck</i>A <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> bestseller!<p>Praise for David Brin's New Uplift Trilogy:</p><p><i>Brightness Reef:</i></p><p>"A captivating read...Brightness Reef leaves you looking forward to more.

Pollock&#39;s large, bold canvases revolutionized the world of art; more than 100 are reproduced here in full color to capture the brilliance of his palette, and six gatefolds show his vast horizontal works without distortion.</p><p>Ellen G. Landau is Associate Professor of Art History at Case Western Reserve University.The role of art historian as biographer is beset with contradictions, an artist's life and art being neither mutually exclusive nor synonymous. Balanced in his life on the edge of destruction and in his art on that of innovation, Pollock mirrored a chaotic world, one in which humans seemed to have lost control. Less gossipy than Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith's Jackson Pollock ( LJ 8/89), this book treats Pollock's personal life, creative work, and cultural milieu as discrete elements that produce a gradually developing image, not always in accord with the public's view of Pollock as rebellious cowboy or counterculture loner. Pollock was the major force behind the transfer of avant-garde art from France to the United States and the American idiom in which it was expressed. This "American Prometheus" is well served by this elegantly illustrated, carefully annotated, and well-written work.

He is the author of eight books, including <i>The Sixteenth Minute: Life in the Aftermath of Fame</i> and <i>Our Land Before We Die: The Proud Story of the Seminole Negro</i>, which received the Texas Book Award.</p> <p>Jeff Guinn is also the author of the bestselling Christmas Chronicles series, which includes <i>The Autobiography of Santa Claus</i>, <i>How Mrs. Claus Saved Christmas</i>, and <i>The Great Santa Search</i>. He lives in Fort Worth, Texas.</p> <br><br>Where exactly did Santa Claus come from? How did he meet Mrs. Claus? Who named the reindeer? We've all asked these questions and a million more, and Jeff Guinn uses a wonderful mix of scholarship, fantasy, folklore, and faith to answer them all. According to this "authoritative" autobiography, St. Nicholas began giving gifts in the third century A.D. and never looked back. John H. Mayer's warm and leisurely reading certainly puts one in mind of the classic nineteenth-century Claus, but it's the generous sprinkling of facts that draws one in. Did you know the Roman calendar had only 10 months and 355 days and that Christmas caroling was introduced to the world in the thirteenth century? A fine way for the whole family to receive a dash of history and humor relating to holiday cheer.

Attempting to define, as O'Murchu valiantly does, a theology that embraces the latest advances in quantum physics can only be considered a task of Herculean proportions. While well-intentioned and well-researched, this book extrapolates farther and farther away from quantum mechanical insights into realms which, at times, are quite speculative in order to create a basis for a quantum theology. For example, O'Murchu begins his system with synergy, the principle that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, a principle that is not inherently a quantum mechanical conclusion at all. O'Murchu gives his argument sharper focus when he describes Stephen Hawking's concept of the birth of the universe, and he does a workmanlike job of creating what might best be called a cosmological theology. Unfortunately, the author's circuitous prose is difficult to follow. However, putting O'Murchu's audacious work into perspective, even Roger Penrose, in his Shadows of the Mind, admitted he was challenged to find a basis for consciousness in quantum mechanics. Finding a basis for God in quantum mechanics may be something else altogether. <p></p><p>Copyright 1996 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Scientific Progress Goes &#39;Boink : A Calvin and Hobbes Collection</h2><p>A new collection of comic cartoons starring the Calvin and Hobbes pair.

Soon afterwards, the two began collaborating on what would become <i>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</i>. <br><br> During her extraordinary career, Simca was mentor and friend to a generation of cooks and food writers. In <i>Food and Friends</i>, she interweaves tantalizing recipes and menus with a wonderfully evocative account of her Normandy childhood, her madcap escapades in 1920s Paris, her work with Julia Child, and her friendships with James Beard, Craig Claiborne, M.F.K. Fisher, and Richard Olney, among others.</p><p><b>Simone Beck</b> was born in 1904 at Tocqueville en Caux, Normandy. In 1933, she began to study at the Cordon Bleu, then the world&#x2019;s supreme school of cuisine. In 1948 she was approached by a friend, Louisette Bertholle (now Comtesse de Nal�che), to collaborate on a French cookbook for Americans. In 1951, at the suggestion of her husband, they began to search for an American to help them, and a friend introduced Simca to Julia Child, then studying cooking in Paris. Soon afterward, the three women formed a cooking school, L&#x2019;�cole des Trois&nbsp;Gourmandes, and began the collaboration that produced the several volumes of&nbsp;<i>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</i>. She died in 1991.In 1911, seven-year-old Beck (coauthor of Mastering the Art of French Cooking ) made her first roux ; 20th-century French cooking hasn't been the same since. In this memoir cowritten with Patterson, she tells her life story both as a gourmet and as a woman. Beck begins at Rainfrevillesic , the comfortable family house where her kitchen experiments began. An unfortunate marriage at 19 in Paris led to divorce and Beck's introduction to a man sporting a "badly tied bow tie"--Jean Fischbachersic , who would become her second husband. Following World War II, she grew interested in writing "a valid cookbook for Americans" about French cuisine. An editor's advice to find a collaborator resulted in her fruitful association with the wife of a U.S. government official--Julia Child. Despite the many pages devoted here to the culinary art, Beck's book is essentially the love story of "Simca" and Jean, and this story is less compelling than might be expected. Her recipes, however, do transcend--be it in the combination of strawberries, currants and lime juice for a timbale aux fruits rouges or the sorrel, parsley and creme fraiche for soupe a la Suraile . Perhaps it is too much to ask that the memories in Food and Friends uplift like the recipes; the recipes alone are a gift.

At first glance, the full-page watercolors and brief text suggest that the book was designed for preschoolers. However, although the facts are presented clearly and succinctly, the somewhat sophisticated vocabulary makes it better suited to slightly older children. Inserts of text and pictures provide detail on each topic. Many of the illustrations are actual-size representations, so readers can get a precise idea of just how big a turkey's egg or footprint really is. The lack of an index and glossary may pose a slight problem, but the text is well organized and finding the required facts should not be too difficult. This will best serve the needs of children seeking information for reports, but the eye-catching art and informative text should draw its share of casual readers as well.<br><i>Arwen Marshall, New York Public Library</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ages 6^-9.

The "read aloud" text concerning the bird's appearance and habits appears in fairly large print, and more detailed information relating to pictures appears in smaller type, as long captions.

The film showed Richardson in his day-to-day work, looking some of the world's most dangerous animals directly in the eye, crouching down at their level, playing with them and, sometimes, even kissing them on the nose--all without ever being attacked or injured. The films' popularity skyrocketed and Richardson became an international sensation. In "Part of the Pride", Kevin Richardson tells the story of his life and work, how he grew from a young boy who cared for so many animals that he was called "The Bird Man of Orange Grove" to an adolescent who ran wild and, finally, to a man who is able to cross the divide between humans and predators. As a self-taught animal behaviorist, Richardson has broken every safety rule known to humans when working with these wild animals. Flouting common misconceptions that breaking an animal's spirit with sticks and chains is the best way to subdue them, he uses love, understanding and trust to develop personal bonds with them. His unique method of getting to know their individual personalities, what makes each of them angry, happy, upset, or irritated&#x2015;just like a mother understands a child&#x2015;has caused them to accept him like one of their own into their fold. Like anyone else who truly loves animals, Richardson allows their own stories to share center stage as he tells readers about Napoleon and Tau, the two male lions he calls his "brothers"; the amazing Meg, a lioness Richardson taught to swim; the fierce Tsavo who savagely attacked him; and the heartbreaking little hyena called Homer who didn't live to see his first birthday. Richardson also chronicles his work on the feature film "The White Lion" and has a lot to say about the state of lion farming and hunting in South Africa today. In "Part of the Pride", Richardson, with novelist Tony Park, delves into the mind of the big cats and their world to show readers a different way of understanding the dangerous big cats of Africa.</p></p><p><p>KEVIN RICHARDSON is an animal custodian and self-taught behavioralist at Kingdom of the White Lion. Previously featured on CBS and NBC, he is also the producer on an upcoming feature film, White Lion: Home is a Journey, starring real lions. He lives in South Africa.</p><p>TONY PARK, is the author of six other books set in Africa, including <i>Silent Predator </i>and<i> African </i>Sky. He splits his time between Africa and his home in Australia.</p><p>ONE</p><p>The Bird Man of Orange Grove</p><p>I spent my childhood in stitches&#x2014;the kind the doctor sews into your skin, not the ones you get from rolling around on the floor in laughter. My mom used to say that I was on a collision course with life. She was a smart one, my mom. There was always a certain wildness in me, that I know. When I look back on my early life, it&#x2019;s easy for me now to see the brave lion, the giggling hyena, and the rogue elephant in the things I did then.</p><p>I loved the outdoors, but when I was growing up my piece of Africa was limited to a few blocks in the white middle-class suburb of Orange Grove in the north of Johannesburg. I grew up during the time of apartheid among neatly ordered rows of houses, straight streets, backyard gardens, barking dogs, and meowing cats, not rolling savannahs populated by herds of wildebeest, trumpeting elephants, and stalking lions. It was the suburbs, but it could be just as dangerous as the bush.</p><p>My mom was always getting calls from school telling her that I&#x2019;d been hurt, or else I would simply show up at home, bleeding. I was never one to do anything half-hearted, so if I was going to cut myself I would come close to losing an entire limb. I would fall through glass coffee tables, off bicycles, and out of trees, and generally do all the things mothers like to cry about.</p><p>&#x201c;We had better buy this little Kevin a sewing machine so he can sew himself up, hey, Patricia?&#x201d; the doctor said to my mom once. The doctor and I saw so much of each other we were like buddies. I laughed, then winced, as the dreaded needle punctured skin again and again and again.</p><p>One of the earliest mishaps that I can remember was getting on my neighbor&#x2019;s full-sized racing bicycle when I was only three or four years old. It was, I think, the beginning of a lifelong love affair with dangerous things and two-wheeled transport. I&#x2019;m into extreme sports, I fly microlights, and I play with lions for a living. I have an old 1969 Triumph Bonneville motorcycle and I love riding super-bikes on the track. My hero is the Italian motorcycle champion Valentino Rossi and while I can&#x2019;t ride as fast as him, I&#x2019;ve probably been in as many crashes as he has.</p><p>I wanted desperately to ride that bicycle and although I was too small to reach the pedals, my neighbor took pity on me and we went for a spin. I was whooping with joy as we gathered speed down the street, the wind rushing in my face as I clung to the older boy. Another kid from the neighborhood, however, thought it would be good fun to push his little wagon into our path and wipe us out. He did a good job and down we went. No one knows how, but in the process I managed to get my toe caught between the bicycle&#x2019;s sprocket and the chain. The cycle was on its side and I was still attached to it, by a piece of stretched skin that was just barely connected to the top of my toe.</p><p>&#x201c;Ag, what are we going to do?&#x201d; asked the panicked owner of the bike.</p><p>&#x201c;We better pull him free,&#x201c; said the evil little shit who had caused the accident. On the count of three the two other boys grabbed me and pulled. Hard. With a piercing yelp on my part, the top of my toe came free from the sprocket and chain&#x2014;and from me.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s moving!&#x201d; cried the bad boy, pointing down at my severed digit. Although I couldn&#x2019;t see it, the other boys swore the tip of my toe was jumping and wriggling like a gecko&#x2019;s tail when the lizard sheds it to shake off a predator.</p><p>While I lay bleeding, my neighbor ran off looking for help and the wagon driver disappeared from the scene of the crime. The cause of the accident&#x2014;and my considerable pain&#x2014;reappeared a short while later with a spade. He raised it over his head with his skinny little arms then slammed it down hard onto the ground, and my missing toe.</p><p>&#x201c;Why are you doing that?&#x201d; I wailed.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s freaking me out. It&#x2019;s alive, man!&#x201d; He raised the spade and smashed down again and again, as if he were killing a snake. Once he was sure he had killed my toe, he dug a hole and buried the evidence. Shortly after, the man from across the road arrived and bundled me into the back of his brand new BMW. It was a lekker car and I bled all over the leather upholstery.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, where&#x2019;s the toe?&#x201d; asked the doctor when we arrived at Johannesburg Hospital.</p><p>&#x201c;Um, they buried it,&#x201c; I said to the doctor.</p><p>The boys were dispatched back to Orange Grove to exhume the missing digit. South African surgeon Dr. Christiaan Barnard may have made history by performing the first successful heart transplant, but not even the most skilled surgeon in the world could reat-tach the crushed, earth-encrusted lump of skin that those two boys brought into the operating room.</p><p>I was born in downtown Johannesburg in the Nightingale Clinic in 1974, two years before television arrived in South Africa, although my family didn&#x2019;t get a TV until I was eight years old. When we did, we were so excited we&#x2019;d watch the test pattern, but it was no wonder that I learned early on in life how to get my thrills in the backyard and on the streets, and with my animals.</p><p>My mom, Patricia, worked as a trust executive for Barclays Bank. She was born in South Africa, but her parents emigrated from England. I don&#x2019;t know exactly what my father, Peter, did, but he worked for a pharmaceutical company&#x2014;in quality control, I think. He had moved to South Africa from Reading, in the county of Berkshire in the south of England, early in his life. Our relationship was very formal and separate. He was a quiet man. I didn&#x2019;t have the chance to ask him too many questions, we didn&#x2019;t do father and son things together, and he died when I was twelve or thirteen. Like most of the people in Orange Grove, we lived in quite a small 1940s brick three-bedroom house on a big block. I had an older brother and two older twin sisters. We lived on a busy street, Ninth Avenue, which connected the major suburbs in the area. We had tarred roads and &#x201c;robots&#x201d;&#x2014;what we call traffic lights&#x2014;and my primary means of transport, until I was old enough to ride a bicycle and, later, steal cars, was my red skateboard.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t have the most privileged upbringing. As kids, we never got pocket money or had many toys. We ran our own jumble sales, finding unwanted clothing and knickknacks and selling them to black African people who were worse off than we were. We&#x2019;d also do gardening chores for neighbors and wash cars. The little money I made usually went for sweets or small toy cars and my dreams were not very grand. The toy I wished for most was a radio-controlled car, but there was no way I was ever going to be able to afford one. I worked hard and finally saved enough money for a remote-control car&#x2014;one of those where the car is attached to the control via a cable. I was so disappointed. I saw myself watching the car zoom around the room while I stood still and watched. Not so with this one. The wire from the remote to the car kept on getting tangled on things and I had to follow the car everywhere like a dog on a lead.</p><p>It was the poor man&#x2019;s version of a true radio-controlled car and not much fun.</p><p>Perhaps because of disappointments like the one with the car or the fact that I didn&#x2019;t have every toy or bike I wanted, I developed a love of animals, reptiles, and insects early on in life. People who know me usually assume that passion came from my mother, but she is not, in fact, a big animal person. It was quiet, reserved Dad who brought our first pet home&#x2014;that much I can remember. It was a tiny stray kitten called Tiger, which he carried in his lunch box. I was about six years old at the time. Dad said he wanted to give us something that we could nurture. He told us the cat had been left to die at a rubbish dump.</p><p>We only went away on holiday as an entire family on one occasion when I was a child, in 1980, to the Drakensburg Mountains in Natal. Money was becoming a problem in our household, so all our school holidays, except for that one to the mountains, were spent at home. My brother Gareth and twin sisters Corrine and Candice and I developed a theory that our parents were giving us pets instead of holidays. After Tiger the cat, there was a procession of parrots, goldfish, and dogs as birthday and Christmas presents. The excuse for not going away somewhere exotic on vacation was that we could not leave the animals behind. My dad probably thought the pets would keep our minds off things at home, which were becoming steadily worse as his grip on his career, and his sobriety, became looser and looser.</p><p>At any one time we would have about four dogs, three or four cats, the goldfish, and several species of birds including pigeons, doves, weavers, mouse birds, parrots, and other wild birds. I graduated to brown house snakes, and eventually to anacondas. Until recently I had an anaconda which was more than ten feet long. It even had its own small house on the property where I now live. Even though Dad was more interested in the pets than Mom, I don&#x2019;t remember him being around a lot to share them with us. As I said, he had a drinking problem. He seemed to be away a lot and eventually he was downgraded at work. Even with all his troubles, I do recall him bringing home more stray animals and injured birds, which helped spark my interest in caring for things. He seemed to be trying to make a connection with us, but at the same time always seemed so distant and far away.</p><p>One of my schoolmates, Warren Lang, kept homing pigeons&#x2014;big white fantails&#x2014;and for whatever reason he was told he had to get rid of them. It seemed natural for me to take them on. Without anyone&#x2019;s permission, we disassembled his pigeon hok (the Afrikaans word for cage) and moved it, piece by piece, three blocks away to my house, where we reassembled it. We then shuttled the birds, one at a time.</p><p>I started breeding the birds and found that I loved it. I woul...</p></p><h2>Collected Poems 1947-1997</h2><p><p>Here, for the first time, is a volume that gathers the published verse of Allen Ginsberg in its entirety, a half century of brilliant work from one of America's great poets. The chief figure among the Beats, Ginsberg changed the course of American poetry, liberating it from closed academic forms with the creation of open, vocal, spontaneous, and energetic postmodern verse in the tradition of Walt Whitman, Guillaume Apollinaire, Hart Crane, Ezra Pound, and William Carlos Williams. Ginsberg's classics <em>Howl, Reality Sandwiches, Kaddish, Planet News,</em> and <em>The Fall of America</em> led American (and international) poetry toward uncensored vernacular, explicit candor, the ecstatic, the rhapsodic, and the sincere&#x2014;all leavened by an attractive and pervasive streak of common sense. Ginsberg's raw tones and attitudes of spiritual liberation also helped catalyze a psychological revolution that has become a permanent part of our cultural heritage, profoundly influencing not only poetry and popular song and speech, but also our view of the world. </p><p>The uninterrupted energy of Ginsberg's remarkable career is clearly revealed in this collection. Seen in order of composition, the poems reflect on one another; they are not only works but also a work. Included here are all the poems from the earlier volume <em>Collected Poems 1947-1980</em>, and from Ginsberg's subsequent and final three books of new poetry: <em>White Shroud, Cosmopolitan Greetings, and Death &amp; Fame</em>. Enriching this book are illustrations by Ginsberg's artist friends; unusual and illuminating notes to the poems, inimitably prepared by the poet himself; extensive indexes; as well as prefaces and various other materials that accompanied the original publications. </p></p><p><p>Allen Ginsberg was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters as well as a winner of the National Book Award for Poetry. He was born in Newark, New Jersey, in 1926, and died in New York City in 1997.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> Counterculture icon, beat apostle, Buddhist chanter, heir to William Blake, unapologetic explorer of intoxicating substances, world traveler, political protest leader, celebrant of gay sex, chronicler of New Jersey Jewish heritage and of Lower East Side post-hippie bohemians, Ginsberg (1926&#x2013;1997) became by the midpoint of his career the most famous American poet of his era. At first hardworking and tormented, later on a spontaneous, welcoming mentor, the writer who in <i>Howl</i> (1956) "saw the best minds of my generation starving hysterical naked," and who mourned his psychotic mother in the wrenching title poem of <i>Kaddish</i> (1960) kept creating entertaining (if not quite so innovative) poems, for almost three decades after he rose to fame. This first complete collection of Ginsberg's work reproduces his 1980 <i>Collected Poems</i>&#x2014;including all the extensive notes: here are "Howl" and "Kaddish" and the great anti&#x2013;Vietnam War poem "Wichita Vortex Sutra"; here too are the poems about Prague and Cornwall, Benares and Shanghai and the Australian outback, the songs and chants in quatrains (with sheet music) and the unashamed odes to beautiful young men. This complete edition adds <i>White Shroud</i> (1986), <i>Cosmopolitan Greetings</i> (1994) and the aptly titled <i>Death and Fame</i>: <i>Last Poems</i> (2000). A hefty, vivid and important tome, it should remind us just how much Ginsberg accomplished. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Holden narrates the story of a couple of days in his sixteen-year-old life, just after he's been expelled from prep school, in a slang that sounds edgy even today and keeps this novel on banned book lists. It begins,<br> <p> "If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them." </p><p> His constant wry observations about what he encounters, from teachers to phonies (the two of course are not mutually exclusive) capture the essence of the eternal teenage experience of alienation.</p>J D Salinger was born in 1919.

This book is the only known personal account of the lead photographic reconnaissance squadron&#39;s scouting dangerous low-level operations, flying the supersonic RF-8A Crusader, during the classified Operation Blue Moon. Captain Ecker was the commanding officer of US Navy Light Photographic Squadron 62 (VFP-62, otherwise known as Fightin&#39; Photo) during the Cuban Missile Crisis, a team created for reconnaissance and aerial photography, and consulted on the movie &#34;Thirteen Days&#34;, which included dramatic scenes of his first mission over Cuba on October 23, 1962. &#34;Blue Moon over Cuba&#34; is an authoritative and complete account of the low-level reconnaissance that might be said to have helped JFK avert nuclear Armageddon.</p><p>A truly remarkable book, this is a welcome change from the more familiar Vietnam-era style books on the RF-B Crusader. --Airfix Model WorldThe Central Intelligence Agency&#39;s (CIA) high-altitude Lockheed U-2 spy plane discovered the presence of medium-range nuclear missile sites being constructed in Cuba on October 14, 1962. This hard intelligence initiated the 13-day crisis that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. As the crisis progressed, the need for more detailed high-resolution aerial photography became apparent to the intelligence community. VFP-62 and its RF-8A photo-Crusader, with its unique forward-firing capability, produced 168,000 photographs of the missile sites, while being shot at by Cuban anti-aircraft weapons. Flying at near supersonic speeds and treetop level, VFP-62 led the aerial surveillance to determine the operational status of the missile sites. For their performance, 12 VFP-62 and four VMCJ-2 pilots received the prestigious Distinguished Flying Cross, and the squadron received the Navy Unit Commendation, presented personally by President John F Kennedy. In a statement, President Kennedy wrote: &#34;The reconnaissance flights, which enabled us to determine with precision the offensive build-up in Cuba, contributed directly to the security of the United States in the most important and significant way.&#34; For the first time this book details the daring missions of the men of this photo-reconnaissance unit.</p><h2>The Yugo: The Rise and Fall of the Worst Car in History</h2><p>Six months after its American introduction in 1985, the Yugo was a punch line; within a year, it was a staple of late-night comedy. By 2000, NPR&#x2019;s <i>Car Talk</i> declared it &#x201c;the worst car of the millennium.&#x201d; And for most Americans that&#x2019;s where the story begins and ends. Hardly. The short, unhappy life of the car, the men who built it, the men who imported it, and the decade that embraced and discarded it is rollicking and astounding, and one of the greatest untold business-cum-morality tales of the 1980s. Mix one rabid entrepreneur, several thousand &#x201c;good&#x201d; communists, a willing U.S. State Department, the shortsighted Detroit auto industry, and improvident bankers, shake vigorously, and you&#x2019;ve got <i>The Yugo: The Rise and Fall of the Worst Car in History</i>.&nbsp;Brilliantly re-creating the amazing confluence of events that produced the Yugo, Yugoslav expert Jason Vuic uproariously tells the story of the car that became an international joke: The American CEO who happens upon a Yugo right when his company needs to find a new import or go under. A State Department eager to aid Yugoslavia&#x2019;s nonaligned communist government. Zastava Automobiles, which overhauls its factory to produce an American-ready Yugo in six months. And a hole left by Detroit in the cheap subcompact market that creates a race to the bottom that leaves the Yugo . . . at the bottom.</p><p>Jason Vuic is an assistant professor of modern European history at Bridgewater College in Bridgewater, Virginia. He lives in Staunton, Virginia, with his wife, Kara.<p>1</p><p>Yugo Girls!</p><p><i>Q: How do you double the value of your Yugo?</i></p><p><i>A: Fill the gas tank.</i></p><p>The original idea to sell the Yugo in America came from California entrepreneur Miroslav Kefurt, who in March 1984 imported three Yugo 45s for display at the Los Angeles AutoExpo. Slight of build yet long in personality, Kefurt was a character. He had come to Los Angeles in 1969 from Prague, Czechoslovakia, where he and his father sold used cars. The Kefurts specialized in one model, the Fiat 600, which they sold in one color: red. "It wasn&#x2019;t that Czech car buyers were demanding red Fiat 600s," remembers Kefurt, "it was because private car dealing was illegal." Technically, Czech citizens could sell their cars only after their odometers had reached 5,000 kilometers. But buying and selling used cars in quantity, as a business, was against the law. Thus, there were no used car lots in communist Czechoslovakia. Buyers simply found their cars through word of mouth or ordered new cars directly from Czechoslovakia&#x2019;s two main auto producers, Skoda and Tatra.</p><p>However, like all Soviet bloc countries, Czechoslovakia had government waiting lists for new cars. To buy a Tatra 613, for instance, car buyers paid full price in advance, then waited six months to a year for delivery. The buyer had no say over the car&#x2019;s color or interior, and received no warranty of any kind. "That was one of the flaws of a communist country," states Kefurt. "Somebody in the government would make a decision of how much of anything could be exported, imported, manufactured, or sold . . . It was the same thing with cars. The government didn&#x2019;t make enough new cars, so a black market developed for used ones . . . But since it was illegal for people to deal in used cars as a business, my father had to be careful. That&#x2019;s why he bought the same make and model [the Fiat 600] over and over, then drove the cars for five thousand kilometers before selling them at a profit. Nobody could tell these were all different cars. It was good business."</p><p>Kefurt&#x2019;s father was a tour guide by profession, which meant he could acquire new Fiat 600s during business trips to northern Italy. He would buy a car, drive it back to Czechoslovakia, then bribe a guard at the border. "Bribes always worked in those days," remembers Kefurt. "You could bribe anyone for anything." His father bought three or four Fiats per year, and each family member had a Fiat registered to them. The goal was to put 5,000 kilometers on each car, a daunting task for the Kefurts, considering the poor roads and lack of interstates in Czechoslovakia. In 1967, for instance, the Central Intelligence Agency estimated that Czechoslovakia had 46,000 kilometers of roads, of which only 10,000 kilometers were paved. By contrast, the United States had over 3 million kilometers of roads, of which 1 million were paved. That was when Kefurt&#x2019;s father had an idea. He and his son would race their Fiats in local road rallies to burn the 5,000 kilometers.</p><p>Kefurt began racing at age fourteen; at sixteen, he placed in one of Czechoslovakia&#x2019;s main road rallies and was well on his way to becoming a professional driver. But in 1969 Kefurt decided to leave Czechoslovakia to live with an uncle in the United States. Through various family connections he secured an exit visa and began working at his uncle&#x2019;s restaurant in West Hollywood, California. Kefurt arrived in the United States in 1969, the same year as Woodstock, the launching of Apollo 10, and the first troop withdrawals from Vietnam. As a student at Hollywood High he found most of his friends owned muscle cars: Pontiac Firebirds and Plymouth Barracudas. They were a far cry from Kefurt&#x2019;s Fiat 600.</p><p>One day while walking along Santa Monica Boulevard, Kefurt passed a Honda motorcycle dealership, which had just displayed the company&#x2019;s first-ever imported automobile in its showroom window, a tiny two-door sedan known as the 600. By almost any mea sure, the Honda 600 was a midget. At a length of 125 inches, the 600 was nearly three feet shorter than the Volkswagen Beetle. At 1,355 pounds, it also weighed 500 pounds less than the Beetle. In addition, the Honda 600 had a four-speed manual transmission, a unibody steel construction, and reached a top speed of 80 miles per hour. The price: $1,275. Kefurt was in love. "Compared to the Fiat 600," he states, "the Honda 600 was a rocket."</p><p>Like many small-car enthusiasts, Kefurt favored the 600&#x2019;s handling to that of larger and more powerful muscle cars. He eventually bought other 600s and opened a business fixing the cars for Hollywood-area owners. Though Honda stopped selling the 600 in 1972, in the early 1980s Kefurt discovered that people were willing to spend thousands of dollars to restore their tiny 600s. The car had a real following, so much so that Kefurt developed a profitable Honda 600 business and was known locally as a small-car guru. He drove and tested not only Hondas but also any other small car he could find. In 1982 Kefurt read that socialist Yugoslavia was producing a new two-door hatchback based on the Fiat 127 and with a 903cc, 45-horsepower engine.</p><p>Known as the Yugo 45, the car was cheap (by American standards) and, in Kefurt&#x2019;s words, "an import opportunity just waiting to happen." The Yugoslavs planned to export the car to Great Britain in mid-1983 but had no such plans for the United States. Therefore, in the summer of 1982 Kefurt hopped into his Honda 600 and drove to the Yugoslav consulate in San Francisco. At the time, socialist Yugoslavia had consulates in California, Illinois, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, as well as a sprawling embassy complex in Washington, D.C. In San Francisco, Kefurt met with an official commercial attach� who assisted him in contacting the Yugoslav auto manufacturer Crvena Zastava, the maker of the Yugo 45. Located ninety minutes south of Belgrade in Kragujevac, Serbia, Crvena Zastava had been established in 1953 in a failing armaments plant in the city center.</p><p>The name Crvena Zastava means Red Flag in Serbo-Croatian, as in the red flag of communism. In later years the Yugo 45 would send up a different red flag among Western consumers. According to economic historian Michael Palairet, the car "was badly built, like all Zastava&#x2019;s cars, and bottlenecks of every kind limited output." Although in 1962 Zastava teamed with Italian car manufacturer Fiat to build a new $30 million factory on the outskirts of Kragujevac, by the 1980s its facilities were outdated. According to one observer, "By US, Japanese and Western European standards, the Zastava works are a throwback to the Dark Ages&#x2014;a Diego Rivera mural choreographed live. Noisy, smoky, and in many places poorly lit, the facilities teem with workers . . . OSHA [the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration] would have a field day here." Zastava also lacked many of the production standards then common in the West, which was the direct result of being the only true car manufacturer in a protected market.</p><p>Kefurt had never been to Kragujevac. He also had no experience with Zastava&#x2019;s low-quality motorcars. But he knew that the Yugo 45 was essentially a Fiat, a car sold in the United States in one form or another since 1957. Even though Fiat had announced that because of poor sales it was leaving the American market, Kefurt believed that he could "keep" Fiat in the United States by importing the Yugo. For that, however, he needed a license, so with the help of the Yugoslav commercial attach� in San Francisco, in 1982 Kefurt sent a telex to Yugoslavia&#x2019;s state-run export company Genex. Short for General Export, Genex was socialist Yugoslavia&#x2019;s main trading house, whose job it was to sell consumer goods and other commodities for over 1,200 domestic firms. In 1982, Genex did $4 billion in business. The company had offices in some seventy countries and in 1986 introduced McDonald&#x2019;s to Yugoslavia.</p><p>Genex put Kefurt in touch with Zastava, but officials there were skeptical that consumers in the United States would buy Yugos. Remembers Kefurt, "They told me that Americans wanted V-8s, that Americans wanted air-conditioning and automatics and that Zastava just didn&#x2019;t make them." Nevertheless, Kefurt was determined. He pestered Zastava until late 1983, when the company awarded him Yugo 45 distribution rights for the state of California. There were no contracts, no negotiations, and no paperwork. In fact, Kefurt&#x2019;s Yugo license, if it could be called a license, was a one-page telex. It stated that beginning with the 1985 model year, Zastava would provide Kefurt with five thousand cars annually. The telex said nothing of price. What is more, Zastava offered no guarantees and demanded that Kefurt pay for each car up front.</p><p>License in hand, in November 1983 Kefurt ordered three Yugo 45s from Kragujevac. They cost a grand total of $7,200 and were shipped to Los Angeles in a forty-foot container that arrived in March 1984. Kefurt was beside himself. He&#x2019;d spent less than ten grand and was now owner, president, and CEO of YugoCars, Inc., the official distributor of Yugo 45 automobiles from Yugoslavia. Kefurt knew it was a long shot, that most Americans wanted V-8s, and air-conditioning, and automatic transmissions. But timing was on his side. Just two months earlier Yugoslavia had hosted the XIV Winter Olympiad in Sarajevo and ABC had given the Games over sixty-three hours of television coverage. There were Sarajevo placemats at McDonald&#x2019;s, Sarajevo postage stamps from the U.S. Postal Service, even a thermos and bowl set from Campbell&#x2019;s, the "official soups" of the 1984 Winter Olympics.</p><p>Night after night, reporters praised Yugoslavia for its efficiency. The Yugoslavs have done "every thing capitalists say socialists can&#x2019;t do," exclaimed one. Buses "run frequently and on time . . . Messages are delivered quickly . . . [and arriving American journalists are] whisked to their village, assigned porters, and shown to [their] rooms . . . Skeptics said [Yugoslavia] couldn&#x2019;t handle a modern Games. Well, wherever Marshall Tito is these days . . . he must be smiling. What the Yugoslavs have pulled off is a tribute to the virtues of nonaligned socialism." The Sarajevo Games closed on February 19, 1984, and were described by Juan Antonio Samaranch, the International Olympic Committee president, as "the best organized Winter Games in the history of the Olympic Movement."</p><p>Next up: Los Angeles. As Kefurt waited for his first shipment of Yugos to arrive in California, Los Angeles readied itself for the 1984 Summer Games. The Games&#x2019; chief organizer, Peter Ueberroth, actually "wondered aloud whether Los Angeles would be able to muster the [same sort of] enthusiasm that Sarajevo had" in supporting its Olympics, then praised Yugoslavia for being one of only three communist countries then planning to attend. (The others were China and Romania.) Since early May, a group of fourteen communist countries led by the Soviet Union had been boycotting the Games because, as the Soviets claimed, the U.S. government had failed "to guarantee the safety of Soviet athletes" in Los Angeles or "squelch the activities of private anti-Soviet groups in California."</p><p>The Soviets alleged that CIA operatives were planning to give psychotropic drugs to Russian athletes in order to "trick" them into defecting, and had "infiltrated members of terrorist and extremist [groups]" into Ueberroth&#x2019;s organizing committee. Ueberroth was livid. If the Soviet Union and its allies failed to make it to Los Angeles, over half of the world&#x2019;s "world champions" would be absent. It&#x2019;ll be a "second-rate competition," said one official, "really no competition at all. [It&#x2019;ll be like a] Pan Am Games with Asians and Africans . . . I mean, what kind of Olympics [is] that?" To ABC, the Games would be a bore, a profit-killing, audience-shrinking bore, which is why, in its contract with Ueberroth, it had stipulated that if the Soviet Union chose to boycott the Olympics, Ueberroth&#x2019;s organizing committee would refund the network upwards of $90 million in fees. Although Ueberroth and ABC settled on a much lower figure, as of May 1984, Los Angeles needed a boost, something to remind viewers that America&#x2019;s first summer Olympics in over fifty years wouldn&#x2019;t just be competitive, it&#x2019;d be watchable&#x2014;in industry terms, "good TV." As it stood, ABC planned over 180 hours of coverage through two full weeks, nearly thirteen hours a day. For months, it had been charging companies as much as $260,000 for a thirty-second spot and had already sold over $428 million in airtime. "If ratings turn out to be less than expected," wrote The Wall Street Journal, "advertisers may ask ABC for compensation in the form of credits," maybe even refunds. Thus, when China, Romania, and Yugoslavia defied the Soviet boycott and sent teams to the Olympics, they were quickly dubbed Los Angeles&#x2019;s "great Red hopes."</p><p>The Yugoslavs called the boycott deplorable and, in mid-May 1984, announced they were sending their largest Olympic team ever: 223 athletes competing in 19 different sports. As one Yugoslav coach put it, "We didn&#x2019;t discuss the boycott at all. [And] why should we? We are an in de pen dent country, and we do what we feel is right. We will not be told what to do by the Soviet Union, or anybody else." Yugoslavia had been independent of Moscow since 1948 when its leader, Josip Broz Tito, announced he was pulling the country out of the Soviet bloc. In the coming decades, Yugoslavia maintained good (if not close) relations with both superpowers, but refused to ally itself with either. By 1984 its foreign trade was almost equally distributed between East and West.31 Yugoslavs drank Coke, wore blue jeans, did business with American firms such as Dow Chemical and Westinghouse, and traded their farm produce for Soviet oil. They "liked to play both sides equally," said one former diplomat. "They could really straddle the fence."</p><p>Yugoslavia was neutral politically, and since it had already competed in the 1980 Moscow Olympics, which the Americans had boycotted, it saw no reason to boycott the 1984 Games. "Sports are meant to be liberated from all political influence," said Ahmed Karabegovic, a Yugoslav Olympic official from Bosnia. And besides, "where the Olympics are concerned, the most important element is business." The Yugoslavs had learned that lesson in Sarajevo, where they&#x2019;d made, by some estimates, at least $20 million. They wouldn&#x2019;t make anything in L.A. They were only participants. But the Yugoslavs hoped that their anti-boycott stance, so praised in the press, would be a good form of "company" PR. And in fact it was. At the Games&#x2019; opening ceremonies, the Yugoslav team entered the Los Angeles Coliseum to thunderous applause, second only to the Americans&#x2019;.</p><p>Yugoslav officials no doubt hoped that Americans&#x2019; goodwill toward Yugoslavia would mean that they&#x2019;d buy, for instance, Yugoslav wines (such as Avia, which Coke distributed) and Yugoslav tools, furniture, and textiles. Who knows? Maybe even cars. At least that&#x2019;s what Kefurt hoped. But then his Yugos arrived. They were red, white, and blue. They had yellow French headlights, tartan interiors, and retread tires. They were three of the worst cars Kefurt had ever seen. "I almost cried," he says. "Before then I had only seen pictures and the pictures were nice but now we can&#x2019;t start things. The doors don&#x2019;t lock. The windows don&#x2019;t go up and down. Then I find paperwork in one of the cars saying that these three were factory rejects. They were supposed to go to France, but there were so many problems with them, the French sent them back!" Kefurt and his mechanic spent the next three weeks making the cars presentable. To the red Yugo, Kefurt added a sunroof, mag alloy wheels, and a "super-duper" stereo system, which he claims cost more than the car. He also took the red Y...</p></p><h2>Altman</h2><p>For decades, Robert Altman fascinated audiences with pioneering films&#x2014;among them <i>M*A*S*H</i>, <i>Nashville</i>, <i>The Player</i>, and <i>Gosford Park</i>&#x2014;that combined technical innovation with subversive, satirical humor and impassioned political engage�ment.

Designed by Hirsch and M�ller as an outdoor shelter, the installation, made of modular bamboo and steel, welcomes visitors to engage in discussions while participating in the convivial atmosphere of shared food. This supplemental publication includes interviews, texts, images, and poems that illuminate the installation's properties of self-sufficiency and how it was conceived as a new component of Tiravanija and Kamin Lertchaiprasert's ongoing project &#x201c;the land,&#x201d; a self-sustaining artistic community near Chiang Mai, Thailand. At the end of the festival, the structure will be transported to Thailand and will be the first building block of a new workshop on the land.</p><p>In a continuation of conversations among artists surrounding the land, this book explores urbanization in a post-rural condition, the act of building as a collaborative process, and land as a concept that can exist outside of ownership. A discussion with Hirsch, Tiravanija, Melasniemi, and J�rn Schafaff reflects on the way in which the installation builds on the land's objectives relating to improvisation, collaboration, and the questioning of institutional structures.

From antiquity to the 14th century, costume was generally long, loose and draped, not nationalistic in character, and reflected magical and religious functions. From the 14th century, when costume became short and fitted, to the 19th century, clothing acquired personal and national characteristics. The third fashion phase, under the influence of industrial mass-production and European expansionism, beginning in the mid-19th century and continuing to the present, is less personal and more international, although there are also exclusive haute-couture designs for moneyed clientele. Readers will delight in the superior 1188 illustrations, including 356 full-color plates, that feature a bell-shaped, skirted terracotta idol from the eighth century B.C., sixth century B.C. funerary stele of the warrior Ariston, late 13th century Sicilian silk cloth, 17th century Rubens and Van Dyck and 19th century Renoir portraits, and a 1965 Saint Laurent minidress. The late Boucher and Deslandres were director and assistant, respectively, of the French Center for Costume Studies. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Across the Land and the Water: Selected Poems, 1964-2001 (Modern Library)</h2><p><b>A publishing landmark&#x2014;the first major collection of poems by one of the late twentieth century&#x2019;s literary masters</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>German-born W.

Featuring eighty-eight poems published in English for the first time and thirty-three from unpublished manuscripts, this collection also brings together all the verse he placed in books and journals during his lifetime.<br>&nbsp;<br>Here are Sebald&#x2019;s trademark themes&#x2014;from nature and history (&#x201c;Events of war within/a life cracks/across the Order of the World/spreading from Cassiopeia/a diffuse pain reaching into/the upturned leaves on the trees&#x201d;), to wandering and wondering (&#x201c;I have even begun/to speak in foreign tongues/roaming like a nomad in my own/town . . .&#x201d;), to oblivion and memory (&#x201c;If you knew every cranny/of my heart/you would yet be ignorant/of the pain my happy/memories bring&#x201d;).<br>&nbsp;<br>Soaring and searing, the poetry of W.

Hotchner</p><p>Paul Newman is a man of many talents. Besides being an actor and an amateur racing car driver, he is a proficient cook with his own line of bottled dressings and sauces, Newman's Own. In this compilation of recipes from the Newman home, there are dishes of his own invention, as well as those concocted by daughter Nell, wife Joanne Woodward, and friends (Ursula Hotchner's veau marengo, Martha Stewart's Victorian savouries, Joan Rivers's shrimp salad). While many of the recipes are standard (and some even dull: Newmanburgers are simply hamburgers served with pickles, tomatoes and onion; Caroline Murphy's tuna salad is made with mustard, sweet pickle, mayonnaise and scallions), and quite a few call for Newman's various bottled goods as ingredients, nevertheless, fans will enjoy eating like their idol.

Brian, Carl, and Dennis Wilson, along with Mike Love and Al Jardine - better known as the Beach Boys, rocketed out of a working-class Los Angeles suburb in the early sixties, and their sun-and-surf sound captured the imagination of kids across the world. In a few short years, they rode the wave all the way to the top, standing with the Beatles as one of the world's biggest bands. Despite their utopian visions, infectious hooks, and stunning harmonies, the Beach Boys were beset by drug abuse, jealousy, and terrifying mental illness. In "Catch a Wave", Peter Ames Carlin pulls back the curtain on Brian Wilson, one of popular music's most revered luminaries, as well as its biggest mystery. Drawing on hundreds of interviews and never-before heard studio recordings, Carlin follows the Beach Boys from their earliest days through Brian's deepening emotional problems to his triumphant re-emergence with the release of Smile, the legendarily unreleased album he had originally shelved.</p><p>PETER AMES CARLIN's award-winning reportage on Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys has appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>People</i>, <i>American Heritage</i>, and the <i>Portland Oregonian</i>, where he is currently the newspaper's television critic. Previously he was a senior writer for <i>People</i> in New York.CHAPTER 1<br><br>It's eighty degrees and sunny in Hawthorne this afternoon, with a gentle breeze brushing against the trees and a sky so perfectly and deeply blue that it seems like a dream. And it would be just another spring day in the Southland, were it not also the day the Beach Boys will be elevated into the official annals of California state history. The ceremony is taking place right here, at the out-of-the-way intersection of West 119th and Kornblum streets, where Murry and Audree Wilson once raised their sons Brian, Dennis, and Carl. Now the spot is marked by California Historical Landmark #1041, a ten-foot structure that is at this moment draped by a large white cloth.<br><br>"When the wintry winds start blowing, and the snow is starting to fall . . ."<br><br>That's Al Jolson singing, his voice echoing from the speakers on the stage that has been set up near the hidden monument. Several rows of chairs line the front of the stage, many of them filled with the wives, ex-wives, widows, children, friends, and compatriots of the Wilsons and their bandmates. A row of journalists--cameras, microphones, notebooks, dangling credentials--comes next, and behind them stands a thick crowd of onlookers. Fans, mostly, some from as far away as Australia. Many wear souvenir T- shirts from long-ago concerts and albums, the faces on them young and sweet, redolent of another time. Their presence here today pays tribute both to the younger musicians pictured on their chests and the younger fans they were when they plunked down the five or ten or fifteen bucks at the merch stand and pulled the shirts over their heads. Perhaps this is why the atmosphere is so hushed, the mood such a strange mix of ebullience and melancholy.<br><br>"California, here I come! . . ."<br><br>Then, from off in the corner closest to the VIP section, the crowd starts to cheer. Brian Wilson has appeared, steered gently by his wife and a few friends to his seat near the front of the stage. He is a large man with broad shoulders, a prominent belly, and a weathered face that is neither friendly nor hostile, but almost entirely impassive. Voices from the crowd call his name, but Brian doesn't look up. He seems detached from the world around him. Or maybe just lost in his own memories of a life touched by so much fortune--good, bad, and horrendous--that he seems less like a living, breathing person than a personification of every dream and nightmare borne upon the westward tide.<br><br>"Right back where I started from . . ."<br><br>Jolson's song comes to an end, and soon you can hear Brian's own teenaged voice coming out of the speakers, captured on a summer evening that passed on this very street nearly forty-five years ago. He's singing and chattering with Dennis and Carl and cousin Mike Love, the four of them smoothing out the rough spots in their vocals to "Surfin'," their first song. "If you laugh, I'm gonna pop you in the mouth! And if I laugh, you can pop me in the mouth!" someone says, but this only inspires a gale of giggles. The voices start to sing, accompanied by a slightly out-of-tune guitar. "Surfin' is the life, the only way for me/So surf! Surf! Surf!"<br><br>There are speeches memorializing Dennis and Carl, then the unveiling of the monument, for which Brian rises to be joined by original Beach Boy Alan Jardine and also David Marks, a Hawthorne neighbor and not-quite-original group member who served for a couple of key years in the early '60s. The three men perform their task in silence, yanking on the sheet to reveal a massive brick-and-brass monolith. They take a moment to examine it up close, pointing to its ornamental records and the brass fresco that shows them as they were, sort of, on the cover of their first album, Surfin' Safari. They pose for a few pictures, then they walk away in three separate directions.<br><br>Something is going on here that no one is acknowledging. And it's not just the lingering sorrows of death or the obvious discomfort felt by the three survivors who have come here. It's larger than that. A feeling that underscores every note they ever sang and every song that drew so many people here. When the current mayor presents Brian with a ceremonial plaque, he speaks emotionally about the vision of Hawthorne the songwriter presented to the world. "I just want to thank you for playing positive music," he declares. "No drugs, no sex, no violence."<br><br>Eventually Jardine gets his turn to speak. He grew up just a few blocks away, and now he's brought his mother and his own kids back to witness this moment. And yet he struggles to be upbeat, plugging his new kids' book and a cable show called Rock Stars and Muscle Cars he says he'll soon be hosting. Then he reflects on old times. "Dennis always gave you the truth. That means more than ever. Especially now." He laughs bitterly.<br><br>Al is referring to Mike Love, the other surviving original Beach Boy. He can't be here today because he's 3,000 miles away playing a show with a group called the Beach Boys that doesn't include any of the other people being celebrated today. Mike sent his official regrets, noting the schedule conflict. But just a few days later, his story will change markedly. "See, my memories of those days are very sweet and great, before I got cheated by my uncle Murry and by my cousin Brian, too. It was a more innocent time." So, why not pay tribute to those times? Mike hemmed and hawed for a while, then shrugged. "I didn't want to go. So how's that? A lot of the people there don't get along with me . . . how about Al Jardine? He's suing all of us now, including Brian Wilson and the estate of Carl Wilson. So I didn't particularly want to see him."<br><br>When Al finishes, Brian takes the stage with four of his current bandmates to sing stripped-down versions of two early songs, "Surfer Girl" ("The first song I ever wrote," he notes) and "In My Room." This last one is particularly poignant, performed so close to the actual spot where he had dreamed it up, lying in his childhood bed fending off the darkness that hovered just outside. "In this world I lock out all my worries and my fears . . ."<br><br>Brian stands stiffly onstage, singing with his eyes closed, losing himself in the familiar melody, the weave of voices that is now as familiar as the walls, doors, and windows of the house that once stood at his back. But the actual house has been gone for twenty years, bulldozed into dust by eight lanes of the I-105 freeway. So what we're really looking at here, gleaming beneath that brilliant afternoon sun, is a line of cars rocketing westward, all of them hurtling away from wherever they came from into the very horizon the Beach Boys spent their lives singing about.<br><br>"California, here I come/Right back where I started from . . ."<br><br>Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys' original songwriter, producer, and visionary, is in his sixties now, a man of age and wealth and almost no discernible interest in the world as it existed before him, particularly with regard to his family and their own journey across the continent to the golden coast where he was born. "We never talked about that stuff," Brian says. It is the spring of 2004, and he's in one of his favorite restaurants, a bustling hillside deli in a mall down the street from his home on the crest of Beverly Hills. "That's the one thing they never did, never talked about our ancestors at all." Now, it's hard to know if Brian is saying this because it's true or because he just doesn't remember any such conversations. Or, more likely, he just doesn't want to address the issue. He's an intimidating man, both for all he's achieved in his life and for all he's suffered along the way. And given the remove of his celebrity and his psychic torment, it's hard to separate the humor from the horror in his eyes when he does recall something his father did like to say.<br><br>"Kick some ass!" Brian is smiling now, in his silly, sad way. "Exactly, that's what my dad said. Kick ass! Kick ass!"<br><br>Murry Wilson was a big guy with a big personality and even bigger dreams of glory. That he would attain them through the work of his sons was a source of great pride and outrage from the old man. "My relationship with my dad was very unique," Brian says. "In some ways I was very afraid of him. In other ways I loved him because he knew where it was at. He had that competitive spirit which really blew my mind."<br><br>"Don't be afraid to try the greatest sport around." That's the story of Brian's life. But also the story of his brothers, his cousin and friends, and all of the ancestors whose ambitions, fears, hopes, and determination delivered them to this land beneath the unyielding sun. California, here we come. Right back where they started from. "Catch a wave and you're sitting on top of the world."<br><br>As described by Timothy White in his intricately researched The Nearest Faraway Place, the story of the Wilsons in America begins in the late eighteenth century, when the first Wilson to venture to the New World settled in New York. The first American-born family member, named Henry Wilson, was born in 1804 and eventually moved west to Meigs County, Ohio, where he worked as a stonemason. His son, named George Washington Wilson in the spirit of the times, was born in 1820, and he and his family farmed a plot of rich, river-fed land in Meigs County for more than six decades until his own son, William Henry Wilson, decided to pursue fortune west to the wide-open plains of Hutchinson, Kansas. So west they went, with patriarch George in tow, settling onto a large, if relatively arid, farm that William Henry soon abandoned in order to go into the industrial plumbing business. Contracts to work on the state's new reformatory system, along with the many opportunities afforded by the modernizing world around them, provided a decent working-class living and a solidly built clapboard bungalow on one of Hutchinson's nice residential streets. As the nineteenth century gave way to the twentieth, William Henry began to think again of chasing fortune into the western horizon.<br><br>California! At the dawn of the new century, this was the setting of every ambitious man's dreams. The real estate flyers papering the town painted in the details, describing the valley soil as every bit as rich and fertile as the sun was warm and the breezes gentle. Thus inspired, William Henry scraped together the cash to buy, sight unseen, ten acres of prime farmland in the southern California village of Escondido. William Henry loaded up his wife, kids, and even his eighty-five-year-old father into the family jalopy; they arrived in 1904 and spent the year laboring on their new vineyard. And though the sun did indeed shine, and the water flowed as promised, and the vines did erupt with fat, juicy fruit, the farming was every bit as hard as it had been back in Kansas, and the money not nearly as vast as previously anticipated. By 1905, William and family were back in the plumbing business in Kansas. Still, memories of the California sun and the dreams of ease and fortune that had once stirred William Henry's soul came to rest in the imagination of his teenaged son, William Coral "Buddy" Wilson. As the boy grew, so too did his visions of the golden future that awaited him in the Golden State.<br><br>Dark-eyed, heavy-browed, and thick-featured, Buddy Wilson took off for California in 1914. Then in his early twenties, the young man--already married to Edith Shtole and the father of a child or two--fairly seethed with ambition. Surely, he imagined, a man with his drive and appetite could find an untapped stream of gold somewhere in that rich, open economic frontier. Leaving his family back in Hutchinson, Buddy would spend months at a time searching for his place in the sun, looking increasingly in the oil fields of the southern coast. Guys could make a fortune if they latched onto the right rig, and so Buddy used his plumbing skills as his entree, working as a steamfitter on the pipes that channeled the gushers out of the ground and into the pockets of the rich men whose example he was desperate to follow.<br><br>But Buddy would never join them in the gilded halls of the powerful. Moody and scattered, plagued by searing headaches and a self-destructive thirst for whiskey, Buddy wandered from job to job to long stretches of unemployment, which he passed grumbling into a glass in a dim barroom. When Edith and the kids finally joined him in 1921, taking the train to the elegant-sounding village of Cardiff-by-the-Sea, he couldn't afford to lease an apartment in town. Instead, the family spent their first two months living in a snug eight-by-eight-foot tent with all the other squatters on the beach.<br><br>Edith took a job pressing clothes for a garment manufacturer, and eventually the family moved to a small home on an unpaved road in Inglewood where the eight Wilson kids attended school, worked weekend jobs, and marched the thin line dictated by their sour father and stern, demanding mother. Escape, such as it was, came in the occasional afternoon bike rides to the open, breezy expanse of Hermosa Beach.<br><br>Escape was a necessity for Buddy Wilson's kids. Buddy, now in middle age and resigned to his life of small prospects and severely limited horizons, had long felt his ambition curdle into resentment. Often awash in alcohol and self-pity, Buddy's bile regularly boiled over into violence, directed most often at Edith. But he could also turn his fists on his children, once beating the school-aged Charles so savagely (for mistakenly shattering his glasses) that Murry, then a teenager, had to come to his brother's rescue, shoving the old man out of the house until he sobered up. And this wasn't the only time Murry had come to blows with his father. Increasingly, the family's second-oldest boy found himself thrust into the role of his mother's protector, raising his own fists against the father he loved but who seemed unable to love him or anyone else in the family.</p><h2>Championship Techniques (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu series)</h2><p>This guide to grappling presents jiu-jitsu practitioners with 112 advanced positions that will give them the tools they need to excel in the sports of submission grappling and no-holds-barred fighting.

After college, armed with a backpack, her personal mission statement, and a wad of traveler&#x2019;s checks, she took off for Australia to see things and do things and Become Interesting.<br> &nbsp;<br>But it didn&#x2019;t turn out the way she pictured it. In a matter of months, her savings shot, she had a choice: get a job or go home. That&#x2019;s how Kelly met John Tanner, a newly widowed father of two looking for a live-in nanny. They chatted for an hour, discussed timing and pay, and a week later, Kelly moved in. And there, in that house in a suburb north of Sydney, 10,000 miles from the house where she was raised, her mother&#x2019;s voice was suddenly everywhere, nudging and advising, cautioning and directing, escorting her through a terrain as foreign as any she had ever trekked. Every day she spent with the Tanner kids was a day spent reconsidering her relationship with her mother, turning it over in her hands like a shell, straining to hear whatever messages might be trapped in its spiral.<br> &nbsp;<br> This is a book about the difference between travel and life experience, stepping out and stepping up, fathers and mothers.

Included are chapters on a multitude of nutritious grains and beans, including new-to-the-U.S. yet actually quite ancient grains like teff, amaranth, millet (used commonly as parakeet fodder) and quinoa ("the pronunciation is KEEN-wah").141 In addition to excellent recipes for grains--such as seven vegetable rice noodles with chile and sesame sauce192 , fresh herb and millet salad with tomatoes119 ,please stet comma/MM and Venetian lemon cornmeal cookies98 --are others for the once-lowly bean, which the Londons call, in bulk, a "mosaic of temptation." Bean recipes here reflect the authors' attitude: a black bean timbale with cilantro and roasted red pepper cream317 ; Napa cabbage rolls with tofu, spinach and chicken451 . While serving sizes do not specify whether the portions are for entrees or appetizers, the Londons leave nearly no grain unturned when it comes to helpful cooking hints--from a method for steaming or roasting sweet corn on the cob to strategies for "long soaking" or "short soaking" beans.83, 302 <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.A decade after their Sheryl and Mel London's Creative Cooking with Grains and Pasta, a health-food-style compendium that had its share of bean complements and was already showcasing such grains as amaranth, sorghum, and triticale, the indefatigable Londons have pulled in some yet newer grains (quinoa; teff) and a separate alphabet of beans, and have contrived yet more of their generally palatable, though somewhat capricious, recipes. They're less doctrinaire this time around--their mashed (not fried) pintos ``refritos'' incorporate bacon, chorizo sausages, and sour cream- -and they draw from a slightly wider range of ethnic ingredients (tomatillos; radicchio), but the same sensibility is at work in this compendium of their own creations and variations. From their cornmeal-blueberry pancakes, their brown-basmati- rice salad, their triticale-carrot cake and their vanilla-barley pudding with tea-poached plums...to their poached monkfish with flageolets and tomato-based coulis and their Spanish cocido of boiled meats and chickpeas, what the Londons offer is variety and novelty in a neo-middlebrow taste range--and lots of it.

Cleon Skousen introduces a new treatment of an old and most important subject. Some of the perplexing questions raised in the Old Testament are answered for all time by the authoritative use of ancient and modern scripture. Some of these questions have persisted throughout the ages: Why did the Lord give Adam and Eve two seemingly contradictory commandments? Where did Cain get his wife? Why did the Lord ask Abraham to sacrifice his beloved son Isaac? What was the reason for the longevity of the early people? How did the priesthood continue on earth during the two thousand years? What significance does the City of Enoch have for present day Church members? These are only sample of questions that have been answered in a definitive way by the author. Since Elder Skousen is the father of six, he knows some of the problems that arise in the minds of young people concerning the gospel. His answers satisfy both young and old. The First 2000 Years partakes of two outstanding characteristics: (1) it is a book that students will wish to ponder and read again and again; and (2) it is a book that the casual reader will lay down after the first reading with satisfaction and understanding and a glorious confidence in God&#39;s eternal plan for man on earth.</p><p></p><h2>Prealgebra by Larry L.

Whilst a student at the University of Kentucky, Tevis worked in a pool hall and published a story about the game for an English class. He would later revisit his love for pool in the novels THE HUSTLER (1959) and THE COLOR OF MONEY (1984), both of which would be adapted into multiple award-winning films starring Paul Newman. Among his other works, THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH (1963) and MOCKINGBIRD (1980) are considered masterpieces of science fiction. Tevis died in 1984."The writing here is taut and evocative.

But nothing will stop her from returning to Pascal -- for if she doesn't wed him, she signs her brother's death warrant, as well as her own. <br> <i>Can there be love between them?</i> <br> From the moment Court discovers that Anna's prim fa�ade masks a fiery, brave lass, his heart's ensnared, and he dares to defy the curse that has shadowed his life -- <i>to walk with death or walk alone.</i> But Pascal vows that he'll hunt the two, never stopping until he's destroyed them both.</p><p><b>*Sign up for Kresley's email newsletter to receive the latest book release updates, as well as info about contests &amp; giveaways ( kresleycole.com/newsletter/ )</b><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kresley Cole is the #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of the electrifying Immortals After Dark paranormal series, the young adult Arcana Chronicles series, the erotic Gamemakers Series, and five award-winning historical romances.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A master's grad and former athlete, she has traveled over much of the world and draws from those experiences to create her memorable characters and settings.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her IAD books have been translated into eighteen foreign languages, garnered three RITA awards, and consistently appear on the bestseller lists, in the U.S. and abroad.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can learn more about her and her work at kresleycole.com or facebook.com/KresleyCole<i>Chapter One</i><i> <p> The Principality of Andorra, 1856 </p></i><p><i> Yes, yes, very well then. Take out his heart."</i> </p><p> For the first time since his beating began, Courtland MacCarrick's split, bloody sneer faltered. The general's impatient command seemed unreal to him, the words sounding hollow and indistinct, probably because Court could see nothing, blinded by blood dripping from a gash on his forehead and by his swollen lids. </p><p> The henchmen restraining him whaled two punches into his stomach, unable to contain their excitement at the prospect of killing off a mercenary, and a rival at that. Court could do little to defend himself in his condition and with his wrists bound. </p><p> "If you kill me," he bit out as he labored for a breath, "you know my men will avenge my death. You would no' risk that over simply payin' us what's owed?" His voice was thick with brogue, as it hadn't been since he'd left the Highlands years before. </p><p> "No one will avenge you, MacCarrick, because they'll all be dead as well," General Reynaldo Pascal said in a casual tone. Though he couldn't see, Court knew the man had a thoughtful expression on his face. The Spanish deserter had never looked like a power-crazed zealot -- more like a benevolent statesman. </p><p> "My kin will keep comin' until they've stamped you out." </p><p> The general sighed. "In any case..." Court could imagine him giving an impatient hand wave, signaling the end of the subject. "...do make it painful and prolonged." </p><p> "You will no' do it yourself?" </p><p> He chuckled softly. "You of all people should know I hire men to do my dirty work." </p><p> As the two yanked him away, Court said over his shoulder, "Aye, but do the fools holdin' me know that you doona pay them for it?" </p><p> They jostled him, heaving him from the room, then strained to pull him down the stairs and outside onto the rough slate street. </p><p> As soon as he felt the sun on his face, he heard a woman gasp; an older man said, <i>"Mare de D�u,"</i> but Court knew better than to expect anything from the people here other than a sharp turning of their heads and the ushering of children inside. Their fear of Pascal was ingrained. Court could be butchered in the town square and no one would lift a finger. Actually, that was a close estimation to what he knew was about to happen. </p><p> Yet he didn't feel as though that was the direction they were moving in. He heard the din of rushing water, realized they were traveling to the river beside the village, and futilely turned his head toward the sound. "No execution in the town center?" he rasped. "Careful that I doona feel slighted." </p><p> "We are being more circumspect with our...activities," said the one on his left. </p><p> "Too late. Pascal's already angered Spain." He bit out the words with conviction, but in truth it was little more than a hope. </p><p> "And we will be ready," the other replied, just before they slammed him up against what had to be a bridge railing. And Court couldn't fight because he couldn't see. </p><p> The water was directly below them, pounding furiously over a drop-off. The Riu Valira was always an angry torrent after rains to the north. He struggled to remember how high this bridge was. Would the Valira be deep enough?... </p><p> He heard a knife being unsheathed. What choice did he have? </p><p> "If you do this now," Court said in a low, deadly tone, "my men and my kin will descend on you. They live for killing." <i>And kill for a living.</i> </p><p> Court knew he couldn't talk them out of planting that knife. These weren't merely two among the general's army -- these were assassins, part of the Orden de los Rechazados, Order of the Disavowed. Court just wanted time to get his bearings. A second stalled was <i>possibility...</i> </p><p> If he jumped, they wouldn't chase him down the river. They'd consider his battered condition, with his hands bound and with the impact of the powerful falls, and reason that he would drown for certain. </p><p> Unfortunately, they'd probably be right.... </p><p> The knifepoint pricked his chest as though poised there -- almost comforting because at least he knew where it was. Then...gone. Drawn back for the blow -- </p><p> He shoved himself back, the force pitching him over the railing, tossing his feet over his head before he landed in the icy water. </p><p> The impact stunned him, his body taking the hit as though crashing into a wall. He sank down so far pain stabbed his ears from the depth, then struggled upward with bound hands. </p><p> Though it went against every instinct, he forced himself to reach the surface facedown as though dead. He sensed the pull of the water and realized that facedown in this case meant being swept from the falls' pool headfirst. </p><p> The Rechazados shot just as the rushing water began propelling him over the rim of the elevated basin. The bullets ripped through the water so close to him he could feel their percussion, but he didn't flinch even when he was forced to dive from above, then ride another series of falls into the main current. </p><p> The river boiled with rapids and swiftly carried him away. Just when he could stand it no longer, he raised his face for breath, but inhaled mostly foam. </p><p> The churning force drove him into rocks, the larger ones knocking him above the surface for lungfuls of air, but his weight quickly wrenched him down to the river bottom lined with jagged slate. The fractures snagged his clothes until they were in tatters, and then his unprotected skin. Each hit took him closer to oblivion. </p><p> Yet he continued to fight and managed to turn himself feet first. The water had washed away the worst of the blood, and the icy temperature had lessened the swelling, allowing him to see from the slit of one eye. </p><p> A high jutting rock approached; he lunged for it, looping his bound arms around it. The current swept on relentlessly until the wracking pressure on the ropes snapped his wrist. He didn't care -- he gulped air. After only moments of rest, the bindings sliced away, leaving him to the mercy of the river once more. </p><p> He'd been in and out of consciousness for what felt like days when the current finally calmed. In the lull, he perceived that the freezing temperature had muted the worst pain of his injuries. In fact, he felt nothing but the subtle warming of the water as he drifted into a static pool by the bank. </p><p> Succumbing to the blackness was an overwhelming temptation now, nearly stronger than his will, but he forced himself to crawl to the stony shore on one hand and his knees. Free of the river, he collapsed onto his back and cradled his broken wrist. </p><p> The sun warmed him, taking away the worst of the chill, and for how long he lay there he didn't know. He only noticed when a shadow passed before it. He squinted to bring a thin line of vision to his one good eye. </p><p> He must've sucked in a breath -- his bashed ribs screamed that he did -- because a woman with shining hair knelt beside him, peering down with widened green eyes. Her lips were parted in surprise, and an unusual stone glinted light from a choker around the pale column of her neck. When she tilted her head at him, a breeze blew a dark curl across her cheek. </p><p> Breathtaking. <i>"Aingeal...,"</i> he murmured as he resisted the blackness once more. </p><p> <i>"Perfect,"</i> she answered with utter sarcasm as she rose and put her hands on her hips. "Simply perfect. This animal's alive." </p><p> Tea. </p><p> Annal�a Elisabet Catherina Trist�n, daughter of the family Llorente, had ridden out for flowers to brighten the afternoon tea. Where did the marsh marigolds grow best? By the river. By the cursed river, where apparently the cursed mercenaries wash to shore. </p><p> She hadn't known what to think when she'd spied the body from afar. Perhaps a shepherd had fallen in the Valira during a storm to the north? Yet as she approached she'd recognized that this giant was no shepherd, and she hadn't missed the nationality. Around his waist he had a thick, wide belt, the style of which was foreign. Attached to the belt had been a swatch of plaid left from some larger cloth. </p><p> Plaid meant Scot. Scot meant killer. </p><p> She bemoaned the situation yet again and tugged on the reins looped over her shoulder, trudging forward, pulling along Iambe, her hunter, who had two hundred plus pounds of Scottish deadweight attached to her. Neither she nor Iambe was used to such labor. Annal�a sighed wearily -- they were both thoroughbreds born for a different purpose altogether. </p><p> She was ill equipped for a rescue -- or truly anything more involved than <i>gathering flower</i>s -- so the conveyance she'd fashioned consisted of a rope tightened around his chest, pinning his arms to his sides, then another rope pulled under both his arms and tied to the saddle. </p><p> But why was she dragging him up the steep mountain incline to her home? Scots were hated in Andorra, and yet she was taking one straight through the narrow rock entrance -- the only entrance -- to the three higher plateaus separating the river from the manor. Her ancestors had gated the passage, and for five hundred years it had kept the horses on their ranch in -- and strangers out. </p><p> Surely he was one of the Highland mercenaries brought here by Pascal. Their tiny, almost hidden country so high in the Pyrenees wasn't exactly overrun with Highlanders. But what if he was the singular Scot who came here for other reasons? And she let him die? She thought he'd called her an angel and he'd looked so relieved to see her, as if he had every confidence she would save him. </p><p> If he was one of Pascal's men, she'd simply have to heal him, then kill him herself. </p><p> After plodding past the crystal lake Casa del Llac derived its name from, she and her baggage arrived in the manor's central courtyard. "Vitale!" Annal�a called for her steward but received no answer. Where was he? </p><p> Smoking, no doubt. Over dice. "Vitale!" This whole place was going to ruin without her brother. "I know you're smoking behind the stable, and I don't care just now!" </p><p> Vitale leVieux peeked his craggy face around the side of the stable. "Yes, mademoiselle -- " he began before he gasped at the injured man, smoke w...</p></p><h2>The Sword of Forbearance (Pelbar Saga, Book 7)</h2><p>The rulers of Innanigan, the last renegade state in North America, stand in the way of the first united, peaceful continent in over one thousand years--and they hold the threat of universal destruction</p><p>In addition to the Pelbar series, Paul O.

Dew finds in the commissioners' brutally candid rhetoric a stark white supremacist ideology that proves the contrary. The commissioners included in their speeches a constitutional justification for secession, to be sure, and they pointed to a number of political "outrages" committed by the North in the decades prior to Lincoln's election. But the core of their argument&#x2015;the reason the right of secession had to be invoked and invoked immediately&#x2015;did not turn on matters of constitutional interpretation or political principle. Over and over again, the commissioners returned to the same point: that Lincoln's election signaled an unequivocal commitment on the part of the North to destroy slavery and that emancipation would plunge the South into a racial nightmare.</p><p>Dew's discovery and study of the highly illuminating public letters and speeches of these apostles of disunion&#x2015;often relatively obscure men sent out to convert the unconverted to the secessionist cause--have led him to suggest that the arguments the commissioners presented provide us with the best evidence we have of the motives behind the secession of the lower South in 1860&#x2013;61.</p><p>Addressing topics still hotly debated among historians and the public at large more than a century after the Civil War, Dew challenges many current perceptions of the causes of the conflict. He offers a compelling and clearly substantiated argument that slavery and race were absolutely critical factors in the outbreak of war&#x2015;indeed, that they were at the heart of our great national crisis.</p></p><p><p>Charles B.

Bernie Gunther&#39;s latest move in a string of varied careers sees him working for an insurance company. It makes a kind of sense: both cops and insurance companies have a vested interest in figuring out when people are lying to them, and Bernie has a lifetime of experience to call on. Sent to Athens to investigate a claim from a fellow German for a sunken ship, Bernie takes an instant dislike to the claimant. When he discovers the ship in question once belonged to a Greek Jew deported to Auschwitz, he is convinced the sinking was no accident but an act of vengeance. And so Bernie is once again drawn inexorably back to the dark history of the Second World War, and the deportation of the Jews of Salonika - now Thessaloniki. As Europe prepares to move on to a more united future with Germany as a partner rather than an enemy, at least one person in Greece is ready neither to forgive nor forget.

He&#x2019;d gone over all those possibilities for weeks, and probably always would&nbsp;... and he suspected she had planned that, as well.<br>He smiled.<br>&#x201c;What is that smile for?&#x201d; she asked, again in Bovarian, the language in which they conversed when alone&#x2014;or in dealing with Bhayar.<br>&#x201c;I was just thinking about the depths behind those seemingly guileless brown eyes.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I cannot believe you are interested solely in <i>those</i> depths.&#x201d; Her slightly husky voice was both warm and slightly sardonic.<br>Quaeryt found himself blushing.<br>&#x201c;You see?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Enough, lovely woman,&#x201d; he declared with mock gruffness. &#x201c;Your brother did say that we were to keep each other warm.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How, dearest, can I do that if you insist on getting out of this warm coverlet in this chilly bedchamber?&#x201d;<br>Eventually, Quaeryt did leave the bed, as did Vaelora, and they washed and dressed quickly. Quaeryt was more than grateful for the warm water waiting in the bath chamber. Just the thought of the cold water in the officers&#x2019; quarters made him shiver.<br>Although Governor Straesyr, when he had been princeps, had lived with his wife and family in one of the row houses along the north wall of the Telaryn Palace, Bhayar had declared that such quarters were not suited to his sister. Quaeryt had suggested that the apartments on the upper east end of the palace proper&#x2014;those that had been occupied by Tyrena, the daughter of the last Khanar of Tilbor before its conquest by Bhayar&#x2019;s father&#x2014;were most suitable for a princeps and that it would be most incongruous&#x2014;not to mention grossly unfair&#x2014;for the newly wed princeps to occupy the larger apartments of the former Khanar when his superior was the governor. That arrangement had been accepted by Bhayar and Vaelora and had certainly obviated possible tensions between Governor Straesyr and Quaeryt.<br>As Quaeryt began to pull on the fine browns of a scholar that Vaelora had insisted that he have tailored&#x2014;because a princeps needed to look the position, as well as carry it out&#x2014;he glanced at his left arm. It was still thinner than his right, while the skin was paler, not that his skin, ever so slightly darker than the pale honeyed shade of his wife&#x2019;s complexion, would ever approximate the near bluish white of the Bovarian High Holders and royal family. Given the beating his body had taken in the battles against the rebel hill holders, he was glad that none of the injuries had been permanent, unlike his left leg, shorter than his right, presumably since birth, since he didn&#x2019;t recall it ever being other than that.<br>Quaeryt waited until Vaelora was dressed&#x2014;in light brown trousers, a cream blouse, and a woolen jacket that matched her trousers&#x2014;before walking with her down the short corridor to the small cherry-paneled private dining room that had once been graced by Tyrena, who had been Khanara in fact, if not in name. There the ceramic stove radiated a comforting warmth.<br>Quaeryt seated Vaelora on one side of the table, then took his place to her left, at the end of the table, where Vaelora had insisted he belonged from the very first day of their marriage. In moments, a ranker in a winter-green uniform appeared with a teapot, a basket of warm dark bread, and a platter on which were cheese omelets and fried potatoes&#x2014;exactly the same fare as in the officers&#x2019; mess, if served on porcelain, and if not quite so warm.<br>Quaeryt poured her tea, then his. &#x201c;I do enjoy breakfast with you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;As opposed to dinner?&#x201d; She raised her eyebrows.<br>&#x201c;No. As well as dinner.&#x201d; He grinned, enjoying the game, holding the platter so that she could serve herself.<br>&#x201c;What will you do today?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What I do every day. I have a meeting at eighth glass with Cohausyt&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s the one with the sawmills who wants to pay to harvest timber on the lands Bhayar got from the rebel hill holders?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the one. I put him off because I needed to find out what finished timber and planking goes for in Tilbora.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Did you?&#x201d;<br>Quaeryt snorted. &#x201c;In a way. I ended up finding out what the carpenters and cabinetmakers pay for wood. I had to work backward from that. Later, I have to meet with Raurem&#x2014;he&#x2019;s a produce and grain factor&#x2014;to see if he can supply grain cakes for the regiments.&#x201d; After eating several mouthfuls, and taking a swallow of the tea, he asked, &#x201c;How are your plans coming for the spring reception?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Madame Straesyr has been somewhat helpful&nbsp;... as has Eluisa D&#x2019;Taelmyn.&#x201d;<br><i>Eluisa D&#x2019;Taelmyn?</i> Then Quaeryt realized she was talking about Rescalyn&#x2019;s mistress, the Bovarian High Holder&#x2019;s daughter the former governor had introduced as Mistress Eluisa. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s still here? I thought she had never married.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s her father&#x2019;s name. He&#x2019;s one of the lesser Bovarian High Holders. She has nowhere else to go, and Emra begged her husband to let her stay and teach their children singing and how to play the clavecin.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I heard her play once.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You told me. So did she. You upset her, you know?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I had that feeling. I was trying to see if Kharst was as terrible as they say.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s worse, according to Eluisa.&#x201d;<br>Quaeryt wasn&#x2019;t about to pursue that subject. &#x201c;From your tone, I take it that neither one has been that helpful.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re really only interested in the wives of High Holders, not the wives of factors.&#x201d;<br>Quaeryt wanted to shake his head. &#x201c;How are your writings coming?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I write some every day.&#x201d; She smiled. &#x201c;The palace library has so many wonderful books.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know. I even read parts of some of them.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You did mention that.&#x201d; Vaelora took a sip of tea. &#x201c;I wish this were hotter.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They have to carry it up from the kitchen.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know. What do you think she was like?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d; Quaeryt had no idea to whom his wife was referring.<br>&#x201c;Tyrena. The Khanara who wasn&#x2019;t. You told me about those few scraps of paper you found with her writing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She was too strong in a situation where there were no intelligent men to marry and manipulate.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Are you suggesting...?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Me?&#x201d; Quaeryt laughed. &#x201c;All men react to women. All women react to men. Intelligent men and women react intelligently.&#x201d; <i>Usually, but not always, unfortunately.</i> &#x201c;From all the documents I&#x2019;ve read, none of the men in power after her father fell too ill to understand were intelligent enough to listen to her. Probably the only man in Telaryn who might have been was your brother, and he&#x2019;s much better off with Aelina.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why do you say that?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Because you said that, and you know them both far better than I do.&#x201d; He swallowed the last of his omelet, and the remainder of his tea. &#x201c;I need to go.&#x201d; He stood, then moved beside her chair, bent and kissed her neck. After a long moment, he straightened.<br>&#x201c;Remember,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;make the factors explain. In detail.&#x201d;<br>Quaeryt smiled. &#x201c;Yes, dearest.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re close to disrespecting me.&#x201d; Her tone was bantering.<br>&#x201c;Close doesn&#x2019;t count.&#x201d; <i>Except in bed.</i><br>&#x201c;I know what you&#x2019;re thinking.&#x201d;<br>He managed not to blush. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you later.&#x201d;<br>After leaving the third-level apartments, he made his way down the circular staircase to the second level, and then to the princeps&#x2019;s anteroom and the study beyond. After almost a month and a half as Princeps of Tilbor, he was still slightly amazed when he walked into the study, although the view to the northern walls and the hills beyond was largely blocked in winter by the mostly closed shutters and hangings.<br>Princeps or not, he still met with Straesyr at the seventh glass of the morning every Lundi, and once he had checked with Vhorym, the squad lea...</p><h2>Saving Your Second Marriage: Before It Starts, Nine Questions to Ask Before and After You Marry</h2><p><p>Complete with twenty-eight self tests&#x2015;two of them brand-new&#x2015;and a new group discussion guide, the expanded and updated <em>Saving Your Second Marriage Before It Starts</em> workbooks for men and women will help couples uncover and understand the unique shaping factors they bring into their second marriage both as men and women and as individuals.&nbsp;</p> <p>Exercises and assignments will help couples identify and meld their love styles, face the myths of remarriage honestly, become soul mates, identify each person&#x2019;s &#x201c;hot topics,&#x201d; and much more.</p> <p>The discussion guide in each workbook integrates with the <em>Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts</em> DVD (sold separately and includes seven pre-marriage sessions plus two additional sessions specifically designed to help prepare couples for remarriage) to facilitate lively and eye-opening interaction.

Their world was an insulated, close-knit community of grass-roofed cottages, cattle herders, and tribal councils. The lions and pythons that prowled beyond the village fences were the greatest threat they knew.<p> All that changed the night the government-armed Murahiliin began attacking their villages. Amid the chaos, screams, conflagration, and gunfire, five-year-old Benson and seven-year-old Benjamin fled into the dark night. Two years later, Alepho, age seven, was forced to do the same. Across the Southern Sudan, over the next five years, thousands of other boys did likewise, joining this stream of child refugees that became known as the Lost Boys. Their journey would take them over one thousand miles across a war-ravaged country, through landmine-sown paths, crocodile-infested waters, and grotesque extremes of hunger, thirst, and disease. The refugee camps they eventually filtered through offered little respite from the brutality they were fleeing.</p><p> In <i>They Poured Fire on Us From the Sky</i>, Alepho, Benson, and Benjamin, by turn, recount their experiences along this unthinkable journey. They vividly recall the family, friends, and tribal world they left far behind them and their desperate efforts to keep track of one another. This is a captivating memoir of Sudan and a powerful portrait of war as seen through the eyes of children. And it is, in the end, an inspiring and unforgettable tribute to the tenacity of even the youngest human spirits.</p></p><p><b>Alephonsion</b> and <b>Benson Deng</b>, and their cousin <b>Benjamin Ajak</b> were relocated from the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya to the United States as part of an international refugee relief program. They arrived in 2001. Now all in their mid-twenties, Benjamin, Benson, and Alephonsion live in San Diego, California.Raised by Sudan's Dinka tribe, the Deng brothers and their cousin Benjamin were all under the age of seven when they left their homes after terrifying attacks on their villages during the Sudanese civil war. In 2001, the three were relocated to the U.S. from Kenya's Kakuma refugee camp as part of an international refugee relief program. Arriving in this country, they immediately began to fill composition books with the memoirs of chaos and culture shock collected here. Well written, often poetic essays by Benson, Alepho and Benjamin, who are now San Diego residents in their mid-20s, are arranged in alternating chapters and recall their childhood experiences, their treacherous trek and their education in the camp ("People were learning under trees"). Other pieces remember the rampant disease and famine among refugees, and the tremendous hardship of day-to-day living ("Refugee life was like being devoured by wild animals"). When the boys arrived in America, Benson, upon seeing a Wal-Mart for the first time, remarked, "This is like a king's palace." Although some readers may wish for more commentary on what life in America is like for these transplants, this collection is moving in its depictions of unbelievable courage. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Here is a gutsy book selection matched to a talented reader who is exactly the right choice for this audacious role. The lyrical way this production can amuse and provoke is realized through the earnestness of reader Kenneth Martines. Like this alternately ribald and wrenching novel, Martines elegantly commands language to foster acceptance. For the narrating character, Shed, so called after the building behind the brothel where he grows up and works, Martines endows words with a magical authority. As expressed by Martines, Shed&#39;s fascination with words can be contagious. D.J.

For anyone who cares about what Americans once were like and can feel the full of such antique human traits as endurance and loyalty and persistence in the face of adversity, it is a fine, warm, often sad, often funny and ultimately affirmative work.&#34; --John Graves, from the introductionIn this masterwork of classic Americana, William Owens eloquently recounts his struggle to overcome the harshest of adversaries - poverty and hunger - to earn an education in the small town of Pin Hook, Texas. He recalls in vivid detail how his mother labored to feed her family and hold it together, and how he fought for knowledge in a land that was for the most part illiterate. This is not only the chronicle of one man's insatiable desire for an education, but a rich chapter in the history of Texas. The book was the subject of a Bill Moyers PBS special.

Paul Tarrant is easily distracted by an intriguing fellow student, Elinor Brooke, but watches from afar when a well-known painter catches her eye. After World War I begins, Paul tends to the dying soldiers from the front line as a Belgian Red Cross volunteer, but the longer he remains, the greater the distance between him and home becomes. By the time he returns, Paul must confront not only the overwhelming, perhaps impossible challenge of how to express all that he has seen and experienced, but also the fact that life, and love, will never be the same for him again.</p><p><p>Pat Barker is most recently the author of the novels&nbsp;<i>Toby's Room</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Life Class</i>, as well as the highly acclaimed Regeneration Trilogy:&nbsp;<i>Regeneration</i>;&nbsp;<i>The Eye in the Door</i>, winner of the Guardian Fiction Prize; and&nbsp;<i>The Ghost Road</i>, winner of the Booker Prize; as well as seven other novels. She lives in the north of England.</p>1<br>They&#x2019;d been drawing for over half an hour. There was no sound except for the slurring of pencils on Michelet paper or the barely perceptible squeak of charcoal. At the center of the circle of students, close to the dais, a stove cast a barred red light onto the floor. The smell of burning coke mingled with other smells: sweat, hot cloth, cigar and tobacco smoke. Now and again you could hear the soft pop of lips inhaling and another plume of blue smoke would rise to join the pall that hung over the whole room.<br><br>Nobody spoke. You were not allowed to talk in the life class. In the Antiques Room, where they spent the mornings copying from casts of Classical and Renaissance sculpture, talking was permitted, and the students&#x2014;a few of the women, in particular&#x2014;chattered nonstop. Here, apart from the naked woman on the dais, the atmosphere was not unlike a men&#x2019;s club. The women students had their own separate life class somewhere on the lower floor. Even the Slade, scandalously modern in most respects, segregated the sexes when the naked human body was on display.<br><br>Paul Tarrant, sitting on the back row, as far away from the stove as he could get, coughed discreetly into his handkerchief. He was still struggling to throw off the bronchitis that had plagued him all winter and the fumes irritated his lungs. He&#x2019;d finished his drawing, or at least he&#x2019;d reached the point where he knew that further work would only make matters worse. He leaned back and contemplated the page. Not one of his better efforts.<br><br>He knew, without turning to look, that Professor Tonks had entered the room. It was always like this with Tonks, the quiet entry. He seemed to insinuate himself into the room. You knew he&#x2019;d arrived only when you saw the students sitting opposite straighten their shoulders or bend more anxiously over their drawings. Tonks was a dark planet whose presence could be deduced only by a deviation in the orbit of other bodies.<br><br>Paul risked a sidelong glance. Tonks, bent at the shoulders like a butcher&#x2019;s hook, was scrutinizing a student&#x2019;s drawing. He said something, too low to be heard. The student mumbled a reply and Tonks moved on. Another student, then another. He was working his way along the back row, passing quickly from drawing to drawing. Sugden brought him to a halt. Sugden was hopeless, among the worst in the class. Tonks always spent more time on the weaker students, which indicated a kindly disposition, perhaps, or would have done had he not left so many of them in tatters.<br><br>So far his progress had been quiet, but now suddenly he raised his voice.<br><br>&#x201c;For God&#x2019;s sake, man, look at that arm. It&#x2019;s got no more bones in it than a sausage. Your pencil&#x2019;s blunt, your easel&#x2019;s wobbly, you&#x2019;re working in your own light, and you seem to have no grasp of human anatomy at all. What is the point?&#x201d;<br><br>Many of Tonks&#x2019;s strictures related to the students&#x2019; ignorance of anatomy. &#x201c;Is it a blancmange?&#x201d; had been one of his comments on Paul&#x2019;s early efforts. Tonks had trained as a surgeon and taught anatomy to medical students before Professor Browne invited him to join the staff at the Slade. His eye, honed in the dissecting room and the theater, detected every failure to convey what lay beneath the skin. &#x201c;Look for the line,&#x201d; he would say again and again. &#x201c;Drawing is an explication of the form.&#x201d; It was one of the catchphrases Slade students sometimes chanted to each other. Along with: &#x201c;I thy God am a jealous God. Thou shalt have none other Tonks but me.&#x201d;<br><br>There was no getting round Tonks&#x2019;s opinion of your work. Tonks <i>was</i> the Slade.<br><br>Paul looked at his drawing. If he&#x2019;d been dissatisfied before he was dismayed now. As Tonks drew closer, his drawing became mysteriously weaker. Not only had he failed to &#x201c;explicate the form,&#x201d; but he&#x2019;d also tried to cover up the failure with all the techniques he&#x2019;d learned before coming to the Slade: shading, cross&#x2013;hatching, variations in tone, even, now and then, a little discreet smudging of the line. In the process, he&#x2019;d produced the kind of drawing that at school&#x2014;and even, later, in night classes&#x2014;had evoked oohs and ahs of admiration. Once, not so long ago, he&#x2019;d have been pleased with this work; now, he saw its deficiencies only too clearly. Not only was the drawing bad, it was bad in exactly the way Tonks most despised. More than just a failure, it was a dishonest failure.<br><br>He took a deep breath. A second later Tonks&#x2019;s shadow fell across the page, though he immediately moved a little to one side so that the full awfulness could be revealed. A long pause. Then he said conversationally, as if he were really interested in the answer, &#x201c;Is that really the best you can do?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then why do it?&#x201d;<br><br>Why indeed? Paul made no reply and after a moment Tonks moved on. At last, from somewhere, a rush of anger. &#x201c;If I knew how to draw I wouldn&#x2019;t need to be here at all, would I?&#x201d;<br><br>He&#x2019;d shouted, though he hadn&#x2019;t meant to. All around people were turning to stare at him. Without giving Tonks a chance to reply, he threw down his pencil and walked out.<br><br>The corridor, empty between classes, stretched ahead of him. Its walls seemed to throb with his anger. The heat of it kept him going all the way to the main entrance and out into the quad. There he stopped and looked around him. What was he doing, storming out like that in the middle of a session? It was asking for trouble. And yet he knew he couldn&#x2019;t go back. Students were sitting in small circles on the grass, laughing and talking, but they were mainly medical students enjoying a break between lectures, and there was nobody he knew. He threaded his way between the groups and out through the iron gates into Gower Street. At first he started to walk towards Russell Square, the nearest green space, but that wasn&#x2019;t far enough. He needed to get right away, to think about his future in unfamiliar surroundings, because although, in one sense, his spat with Tonks had been relatively trivial, he felt that it marked a crisis in his career.<br><br>If you could call it a career.<br><br>*<br><br>He&#x2019;d been walking round and round the lake for over an hour. His shadow, hardly visible when he first entered the park, now trotted at his heels like a stunted child. Round and round the problem went: no talent, wasting my time, better leave now and get a job. Or would it be more sensible to wait till the end of the year? He&#x2019;d always intended to spend two years at the Slade and it seemed a bit feeble to leave before the first year was over, but then what was the point of continuing when his work not only failed to improve but actually seemed to deteriorate from week to week? It wasn&#x2019;t as if he had unlimited money. He had a legacy from his grandmother, a slum landlord of quite astonishing rapacity who, by skimping on repairs and bringing up her large family on bread and scrape, had salted away a great deal of money in the box under her bed. What would her advice have been?<br><br>&#x2014;<i>Have nowt to do with nancy&#x2013;boy stuff like art, there&#x2019;s no money in that, and if you&#x2019;ve got tangled up in it, lad, get out as fast as you can.</i><br><br>She&#x2019;d been horrified when he went to work as an orderly in a hospital; real men earned their living by their own sweat and blood.<br><br>This was getting him nowhere. He found a bench and sat down, feeling the heat heavy on his shoulder blades. Craning his neck, he looked up at the tops of the trees, dark against the pulsing sun. Everything was flooded in lemony light. After a while he straightened up and looked about him, and it was then that he became aware of the girl on the other side of the lake.<br><br>A young girl, still with the childish blondeness that rarely survives into adult life, was wandering along the waterside. She was about fifteen, dressed in the shabby, respectable clothes of a maid, her only ornament a bunch of purple velvet violets pinned to the crown of her black straw hat. Sent into service, he guessed, away from her own overcrowded home. Girls that age are not easily accommodated in two&#x2013;bedroomed houses, parents needing privacy, adolescent brothers curious, younger children sleeping four to a bed. This would be her afternoon off.<br><br>He tracked her with his eyes. A few paces further on she stopped, standing at the water&#x2019;s edge looking down into the depths. Thinking they were going to be fed, swans, geese, and ducks set off towards her from all parts of the lake, so that the slim, gray figure quickly became the focal point of thirty or more converging lines. There was something odd about her and at first he couldn&#x2019;t think what it was, but then he noticed that the buttons on her blouse had been done up in the wrong sequence. There was a glimpse of what might have been bare flesh between the edge of her blouse and her skirt. He kept expecting her to pull her shawl more closely round her or turn away and put herself to rights. But she did neither. Instead she stumbled a few feet further along, then stopped again, the shadows of rippling water playing over her face and neck.<br><br>She was swaying on her feet. At first he thought nothing of it, but then it happened again, and again. It came to him in a flash. Incredibly, this fresh&#x2013;faced, innocent&#x2013;looking girl was drunk. He looked up and down the path to see if she was alone and there, about twenty yards behind, stood a portly, middle&#x2013;aged man watching her. Ah, authority. Probably the man was her employer&#x2014;he was too well&#x2013;dressed to be her father&#x2014;but then, if he had a legitimate reason to be interested in her, why did he not approach and take control of the situation? Instead of strolling along at that loitering, predatory pace, his eyes fixed on her back. No, he was nothing to do with her&#x2014;unless of course he was the man responsible for her condition. That, or he&#x2019;d noticed the state she was in and recognized easy pickings when he saw them.<br><br>Bastard. All Paul&#x2019;s long frustration in the life class&#x2014;a frustration which could never be vented on Professor Tonks because he respected the man too much&#x2014;boiled over into hatred of this man with his florid cheeks and his expensive suit and his silver&#x2013;topped cane. He jumped up and began striding along the path, meaning to cut them off before they reached the gate.<br><br>The sun, past its height, had begun to throw long bluish shadows across the grass. Paul&#x2019;s heels rang out on the pavement as he half walked, half ran round the head of the lake. He felt vigorous, clear. All the disappointments and complexities of the past few months had dropped away. He drew level with the girl, who had once more paused and was gazing out over the lake. A few yards away from her the geese were beginning to come ashore. Big, webbed yellow feet made puddles of wet on the dusty path as they lurched towards her, open beaks hissing. Startled, she took off her shawl and flapped it at them until at last, honking and hissing, they flopped, one by one, into the water again.<br><br>Now that Paul was closer he could see that her hair had slipped loose from the pins at the nape of her neck and straggled down her back. The blouse was badly torn, it must have been ripped off her back. Looking down, he saw that only one foot had a stocking on; the other was thrust bare into a down&#x2013;at&#x2013;heel shoe. He looked at the slim, naked ankle and felt a tweak of lust that hardly broke the surface of his consciousness before it was transmuted into anger. Who had done this to her? She was such a child. He was afraid to startle her by speaking to her and, anyway, she might well misconstrue his intentions.<br><br>The middle&#x2013;aged man had stopped a few yards away and was gazing at him with obvious resentment. Paul turned to stare at him. Medium height, heavily built, bulky about the shoulders and chest, but a lot of that was flab. His trouser buttons strained to accommodate his postprandial belly. His eyes kept sliding away from Paul to the girl and back again. At last he stepped to one side, ostentatiously allowing Paul plenty of room to pass. Paul held his ground.<br><br>Meanwhile, the girl tried to move on, but staggered and almost fell. She seemed disorientated now and after standing for a moment simply flopped down on the path. With a glance at Paul the man moved towards her. Paul stepped forward to cut him off.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; the man said.<br><br>A Yorkshire accent? &#x201c;Are you responsible for this?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I never saw her before in my life.&#x201d; Grayish&#x2013;green eyes, the color of infected phlegm. &#x201c;I was going to put her in a cab and send her back to her family.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2019;Course you were.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have a better idea?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We could take her to the police station.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I doubt if she&#x2019;d thank you for that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s ask her, shall we?&#x201d;<br><br>The man leaned forward in a fug of port&#x2013;wine breath. &#x201c;Look, piss off, will you? I saw her first.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going anywhere.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not your business.&#x201d; A hiss the geese would have been proud of. &#x201c;For God&#x2019;s sake, look at her. Don&#x2019;t you think you&#x2019;re closing the stable door after the horse&#x2019;s bolted?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And a slice off a cut cake won&#x2019;t be missed. What a fund of homely northern wisdom you are.&#x201d;<br><br>Gooseberry&#x2013;green eyes swelled to bursting. A purpling of pendulous cheeks, then Paul caught a flash of silver from the upraised cane. He raised his arm to break the blow and pain jolted from his forearm into his shoulder. Now he had his excuse, his legitimate reason. He twisted the cane out of the other&#x2019;s hand and brought it crashing down onto his shoulders, once, twice, three times, and then he lost count. There was no reason ever to stop, he&#x2019;d never felt such joy, strength seemed to flow into him from the sky. But a minute later, as the man turned away, presenting only his bowed shoulders to the blows, Paul started to recover himself. In a final burst of exhilaration, he sent the cane whirling in a broad arc over the lake, its silver knob flashing in the sun.<br><br>&#x201c;Fetch!&#x201d; he shouted, feeling his spit fly. &#x201c;Go on, boy, fetch!&#x201d;<br><br>The cane plopped and sank. Concentric rings of ripples laced with foam spread out over the surface of the water. Its owner turned to face Paul, goosegog eyes red veined with rage. &#x201c;Do you know how much that cost?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;More than the girl, I&#x2019;ll bet.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Hedge of Thorns (Rare Collector&#39;s Series)</h2><p>Based on a true story, here is a gripping account of a young boy who learns the hard way that the choices we make can harm those we love the most.

He and a small band of men in three canoes had become the first to navigate the entire length of the Mississippi River--"the object of his day-dreams, the destined avenue of his ambition and his hopes." He claimed the river and its enormous watershed for France and named it after King Louis XIV. Five years later, while searching for an overland route to the Mississippi, La Salle was killed by mutinous members of his party. La Salle had spent nearly half of his 42 years in North America, enjoying some triumphs and enduring many hardships. <p> Francis Parkman, one of America's greatest historians, tells the story of La Salle, his rivals, and the struggle over North America in <i>La Salle and the Discovery of the Great West</i>. Parkman was an adventurer himself (he recounts his own five-month trek through the American wilderness in <i>The Oregon Trail</i>), and his experiences on the (admittedly different) frontier lent him a certain authority. He wrote with a fluid, 19th-century grace--"All day there was feasting without respite, after the merciless practice of Indian hospitality"--though some readers may find his prose too florid. First published as part of his epic seven-volume study, <i>France and England in North America</i>, <i>La Salle</i> has been inexplicably out of print for decades. Jon Krakauer (<i>Into Thin Air</i>) rescued this classic for reissue in the Modern Library's Exploration series. With an introduction by Rick Bass, <i>La Salle and the Discovery of the Great West</i> is a welcome addition to the early history of North America. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p>"Parkman was . . . perhaps the first great historian the United States produced, certainly still one of [the] most notable.

Two years later, he was given the order to colonize and govern the great expanse of territory between Lake Michigan and the Gulf of Mexico. He set out from France with four ships but never reached his destination. Landing somewhere in East Texas, he and his men were ravaged by disease, weakened by hard labor, even gored by buffalo as they tried to locate the mouth of the Mississippi River, which was obscured by the sandy sameness of the Gulf coastline. In 1687, on a third attempt to locate the river by an overland route, La Salle was murdered by his own men in the desolate country between the Trinity and Brazos rivers.

These mighty sermons from Isaiah chapter 40 bear this out, and in this they meet one of our greatest needs today to know our God as he really is. They show that the God of the Bible is not only the great Creator and Judge but the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort who meets us at the point of our deepest need. This all-sufficient God has already met and answered all our problems, doubts, and difficulties, in the gospel of his Son, Jesus Christ. Those hungering to know God-or to know him better-will find great help here, while those who have already tasted the rich gospel provision in earlier Lloyd-Jones titles on Old Testament themes such as God&#39;s Way Not Ours (on Isaiah 1) and Old Testament Evangelistic Sermons will need little urging to return for more!</p><p>D. MARTYN LLOYD-JONES was born in South Wales. He trained at St. Bartholomew&#39;s Hospital and thereafter practised as a physician and was assistant to the famous Lord Horder. After leaving medicine in 1927, he became the minister of a Welsh Presbyterian Church in Aberavon, South Wales. He was there until 1938, when he moved to London to share the ministry of Westminster Chapel with Dr. G. Campbell Morgan, who retired in 1943. This ministry lasted for thirty years until Dr. Lloyd-Jones retired in August 1968. He then engaged in a wider preaching ministry and in writing until shortly before his death in 1981.</p><h2>Kith</h2><p>From the amazing imagination of bestselling author Holly Black, a mysterious and wonderful teen graphic novel masterpiece.<br><br>Rue Silver's life is not what it appears to be.

At the same time, the faerie realm is venturing into our world too, and taking its toll on those Rue loves.

He has also illustrated the popular Death Jr. and Gloomcookie series.Grade 7 Up&#x2013;This sequel to <i>Kin</i> (Scholastic, 2008) answers many of the questions that were left hanging in that book. Most importantly, readers will learn what happens to Rue Silver's plan to rescue her mother from the land of the faeries and about her grandfather's plot against humanity, which involves transforming human sacrifices into living trees. There are several powerful scenes in which Rue's friends are literally and figuratively seduced by faeries, with tragic consequences, but the most moving scenes involve Rue's parents. When Rue tries to free her mother, she is faced with the painful revelation that the woman has no interest in rejoining the human world. And her father is torn between his allegiance to his wife and his emotional connection to his human lover. Readers will need to be familiar with the first book in the series in order to understand what's going on, and there is a major cliff-hanger that should be resolved in the third volume. Unfortunately, even fans of <i>Kin</i> may have trouble following all of the plot points and keeping the characters straight. While Naifeh's haunting and textured black-and-white illustrations are captivating, <i>Kith</i> does not live up to the promise of <i>Kin</i>.<i>&#x2013;Andrea Lipinski, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Richard Curtis's <i>Notting Hill</i> is a funny, enchanting, lighthearted take on just such a fairy-tale premise. Curtis's screenplay of the film--which stars Hugh Grant as an ordinary British bookstore owner and Julia Roberts as the world-famous actress who waltzes into his store and his life--makes for an effective and enjoyable read, chock full of the snappy, witty dialogue that made Curtis's <i>Four Weddings and a Funeral</i> such a hit. Fans of the movie will be pleased to relive such moments as Roberts's and Grant's first embarrassing meetings and her appearance at a small dinner party for Grant's sister, where she turns the situation upside-down. On the page, the story is charming if a bit slight (it doesn't feature a rowdy and riotous supporting cast � la <i>Four Weddings</i>), but as wish fulfillment and romantic comedy, it's irresistible and will leave a smile on your face to rival that of our heroine. In addition to the finished script, the book includes scenes that didn't make the final cut (great ones, too--it's too bad they won't be seen); loads of color stills from the movie; an engaging introduction by Curtis detailing the genesis of the film; and an affable if offbeat afterword from Hugh Grant himself. <i>--Mark Englehart</i></p><h2>Democratic Promise: The Populist Moment in America</h2><p>Presents a major reinterpretation of the most important American reform movement of the late 19th century.</p><p>Lawrence Goodwyn, Professor of History, Duke University.</p><h2>The Complete Guide to American Pocket Watches</h2><p>Guide used for Pocket Watches Collectors and Dealers.</p><p></p><h2>The End Of Eternity</h2><p>Andrew Harlan is an Eternal, a man whose job it is to range through past and present Centuries, monitoring and, where necessary, altering Time&#39;s myriad cause-and-effect relationships.

TECHNICIAN</p><p>Andrew Harlan stepped into the kettle. Its sides were perfectly round and it fit snugly inside a vertical shaft composed of widely spaced rods that shimmered into an unseeable haze six feet above Harlan&#x2019;s head. Harlan set the controls and moved the smoothly working starting lever.</p><p>The kettle did not move.</p><p>Harlan did not expect it to. He expected no movement; neither up nor down, left nor right, forth nor back. Yet the spaces between the rods had melted into a gray blankness which was solid to the touch, though nonetheless immaterial for all that. And there was the little stir in his stomach, the faint (psychosomatic?) touch of dizziness, that told him that all the kettle contained, including himself, was rushing upwhen through Eternity.</p><p>He had boarded the kettle in the 575th Century, the base of operations assigned him two years earlier. At the time the 575th had been the farthest upwhen he had ever traveled. Now he was moving upwhen to the 2456th Century.</p><p>Under ordinary circumstances he might have felt a little lost at the prospect. His native Century was in the far downwhen, the 95th Century, to be exact. The 95th was a Century stiffly restrictive of atomic power, faintly rustic, fond of natural wood as a structural material, exporters of certain types of distilled potables to nearly everywhen and importers of clover seed. Although Harlan had not been in the 95th since he entered special training and became a Cub at the age of fifteen, there was always that feeling of loss when one moved outwhen from "home." At the 2456th he would be nearly two hundred forty millennia from his birth when and that is a sizable distance even for a hardened Eternal.</p><p>Under ordinary circumstances all this would be so.</p><p>But right now Harlan was in poor mood to think of anything but the fact that his documents were heavy in his pocket and tense, a little confused.</p><p>It was his hands acting by themselves that brought the kettle to the proper halt at the proper Century.</p><p>Strange that a Technician should feel tense or nervous about anything. What was it that Educator Yarrow had once said:</p><p>"Above all, a Technician must be dispassionate. The Reality Change he initiates may affect the lives of as many as fifty billion people. A million or more of these may be so drastically affected as to be considered new individuals. Under these conditions, an emotional make-up is a distinct handicap."</p><p>Harlan put the memory of his teacher&#x2019;s dry voice out of his mind with an almost savage shake of his head. In those days he had never imagined that he himself would have the peculiar talent for that very position. But emotion had come upon him after all. Not for fifty billion people. What in Time did he care for fifty billion people? There was just one. One person.</p><p>He became aware that the kettle was stationary and with the merest pause to pull his thoughts together, put himself into the cold, impersonal frame of mind a Technician must have, he stepped out. The kettle he left, of course, was not the same as the one he had boarded, in the sense that it was not composed of the same atoms. He did not worry about that any more than any Eternal would. To concern oneself with the mystique of Time-travel, rather than with the simple fact of it, was the mark of the Cub and newcomer to Eternity.</p><p>He paused again at the infinitely thin curtain of non-Space and non-Time which separated him from Eternity in one way and from ordinary Time in another.</p><p>This would be a completely new section of Eternity for him. He knew about it in a rough way, of course, having checked upon it in the Temporal Handbook. Still, there was no substitute for actual appearance and he steeled himself for the initial shock of adjustment.</p><p>He adjusted the controls, a simple matter in passing into Eternity (and a very complicated one in passing into Time, a type of passage which was correspondingly less frequent). He stepped through the curtain and found himself squinting at the brilliance. Automatically he threw up his hand to shield his eyes.</p><p>Only one man faced him. At first Harlan could see him only blurrily.</p><p>The man said, "I am Sociologist Kantor Voy. I imagine you are Technician Harlan."</p><p>Harlan nodded and said, "Father Time! Isn&#x2019;t this sort of ornamentation adjustable?"</p><p>Voy looked about and said tolerantly, "You mean the molecular films?"</p><p>"I certainly do," said Harlan. The Handbook had mentioned them, but had said nothing of such an insane riot of light reflection.</p><p>Harlan felt his annoyance to be quite reasonable. The 2456th Century was matter-oriented, as most Centuries were, so he had a right to expect a basic compatibility from the very beginning. It would have none of the utter confusion (for anyone born matter-oriented) of the energy vortices of the 300&#x2019;s, or the field dynamics of the 600&#x2019;s. In the 2456th, to the average Eternal&#x2019;s comfort, matter was used for everything from walls to tacks.</p><p>To be sure, there was matter and matter. A member of an energy-oriented Century might not realize that. To him all matter might seem minor variations on the theme that was gross, heavy, and barbaric. To matter-oriented Harlan, however, there was wood, metal (subdivisions, heavy and light), plastic, silicates, concrete, leather, and so on.</p><p>But matter consisting entirely of mirrors!</p><p>That was his first impression of the 2456th. Every surface reflected and glinted light. Everywhere was the illusion of complete smoothness; the effect of a molecular film. And in the ever-repeated reflection of himself, of Sociologist Voy, of everything he could see, in scraps and wholes, in all angles, there was confusion. Garish confusion and nausea!</p><p>"I&#x2019;m sorry," said Voy, "it&#x2019;s the custom of the Century, and the Section assigned to it finds it good practice to adopt the customs where practical. You get used to it after a time."</p><p>Voy walked rapidly upon the moving feet of another Voy, upside down beneath the floor, who matched him stride for stride. He reached to move a hair-contact indicator down a spiral scale to point of origin.</p><p>The reflections died; extraneous light faded. Harlan felt his world settle.</p><p>"If you&#x2019;ll come with me now," said Voy.</p><p>Harlan followed through empty corridors that, Harlan knew, must moments ago have been a riot of made light and reflection, up a ramp, through an anteroom, into an office.</p><p>In all the short journey no human being had been visible. Harlan was so used to that, took it so for granted, that he would have been surprised, almost shocked, if a glimpse of a human figure hurrying away had caught his eyes. No doubt the news had spread that a Technician was coming through. Even Voy kept his distance and when, accidentally, Harlan&#x2019;s hand had brushed Voy&#x2019;s sleeve, Voy shrank away with a visible start.</p><p>Harlan was faintly surprised at the touch of bitterness he felt at this. He had thought the shell he had grown about his soul was thicker, more efficiently insensitive than that. If he was wrong, if his shell had worn thinner, there could only be one reason for that.</p><p>No�s!</p><p>Sociologist Kantor Voy leaned forward toward the Technician in what seemed a friendly enough fashion, but Harlan noted automatically that they were seated on opposite sides of the long axis of a fairly large table.</p><p>Voy said, "I am pleased to have a Technician of your reputation interest himself in our little problem here."</p><p>"Yes," said Harlan with the cold impersonality people would expect of him. "It has its points of interest." (Was he impersonal enough? Surely his real motives must be apparent, his guilt be spelled out in beads of sweat on his forehead.)</p><p>He removed from an inner pocket the foiled summary of the projected Reality Change. It was the very copy which had been sent to the Allwhen Council a month earlier. Through his relationship with Senior Computer Twissell (the Twissell, himself) Harlan had had little trouble in getting his hands on it.</p><p>Before unrolling the foil, letting it peel off onto the table top where it would be held by a soft paramagnetic field, Harlan paused a split moment.</p><p>The molecular film that covered the table was subdued but was not zero. The motion of his arm fixed his eye and for an instant the reflection of his own face seemed to stare somberly up at him from the tabletop. He was thirty-two, but he looked older. He needed no one to tell him that. It might be partly his long face and dark eyebrows over darker eyes that gave him the lowering expression and cold glare associated with the caricature of the Technician in the minds of all Eternals. It might be just his own realization that he was a Technician.</p><p>But then he flicked the foil out across the table and turned to the matter at hand.</p><p>"I am not a Sociologist, sir."</p><p>Voy smiled. "That sounds formidable. When one begins by expressing lack of competence in a given field, it usually implies that a flat opinion in that field will follow almost immediately."</p><p>"No," said Harlan, "not an opinion. Just a request. I wonder if you won&#x2019;t look over this summary and see if you haven&#x2019;t made a small mistake somewhere here."</p><p>Voy looked instantly grave. "I hope not," he said.</p><p>Harlan kept one arm across the back of his chair, the other in his lap. He must let neither hand drum restless fingers. He must not bite his lips. He must not show his feelings in any way.</p><p>Ever since the whole orientation of his life had so changed itself, he had been watching the summaries of projected Reality Changes as they passed through the grinding administrative gears of the Allwhen Council. As Senior Computer Twissell&#x2019;s personally assigned Technician, he could arrange that by a slight bending of professional ethics. Particularly with Twissell&#x2019;s attention caught ever more tightly in his own overwhelming project. (Harlan&#x2019;s nostrils flared. He knew now a little of the nature of that project.)</p><p>Harlan had had no assurance that he woul...</p></p><h2>The Conquest of Bread: 150 Years of Agribusiness in California</h2><p><p>For over a century, California has been the world&#x2019;s most advanced agricultural zone, an agrarian juggernaut that not only outproduces every state in America, but also most countries. California&#x2019;s success, however, has come at significant costs. Never a family-farm region like the Midwest, California&#x2019;s landscape and Mediterranean climate have been manipulated and exploited to serve modern business interests. Home to gargantuan accomplishments such as the world&#x2019;s largest water storage and transfer network, California also relies on an army of Mexican farm laborers who live and work under dismal conditions.</p><p>In <em>The Conquest of Bread</em>, acclaimed historian Richard A. Walker offers a wide-angle overview of the agro-industrial system of production in California from farm to table. He lays bare the long evolution of each link in the food chain, showing how a persistent emphasis on productivity and growth allowed California to outpace agriculture elsewhere in the United States. Full of thunder and surprises, <em>The Conquest of Bread</em> allows the reader to weigh the claims of both boosters and critics in the debate over the most extraordinary agricultural profusion in the modern world.</p><br></p><p>Richard A. Walker is professor emeritus and former chair of geography at the University of California, Berkeley. He is the author of <em>The Country in the City</em> and <em>The Conquest of Bread</em> (The New Press) and a co-author, with Michael Storper, of <em>The Capitalist Imperative</em> and, with Andrew Sayer, of <em>The New Social Economy</em>. He lives in Berkeley, California.<br>Walker, a Geography professor at UC Berkley and co-author of The Capitalist Imperative, has written an all-encompassing study of one of California&#x2019;s main cash cows outside the silver screen and dot-coms&#x2014;food. Methodical and meticulous, he examines key aspects of the state&#x2019;s agriculture industry, delving deep into its history and patiently setting forth explanations of its inner workings. With its 200-plus crops and substantial canned goods business, California is king among the states in production and revenue for both farming and food processing. After introducing this landscape of abundance, Walker discusses the essential components of California&#x2019;s agribusiness: laborers, growers and landowners; the land and its products; machines and biotechnology; and marketing and capital. He explores each topic systematically, providing a chronological view of the industry&#x2019;s development, complete with details about the state&#x2019;s rich historical background. More than a few charts and graphs accompany the text, but Walker&#x2019;s writing is rarely technical or overly academic. Though much has been written about farming in California, Walker&#x2019;s command of that literature and the relevant statistics allows him to present a comprehensive overview of California&#x2019;s thriving agribusiness. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His hair might have once been even closer to white, and it now showed darker streaks, making it more white-gray than white-blond.</p><p>Only a few noises reached him from the little seaside town a short walk inland. He never looked back and only stared out over the water, as if he already knew every sound that he heard.</p><p>A pale glimmer like an old worn road of light ran from the shore beyond his outstretched legs and tall boots to the horizon, where the sun had sunk beyond sight and the ocean. He was quiet and still, for he was not truly looking for anything out there. Lost elsewhere in thought, perhaps he didn&#x2019;t hear ever-so-soft footfalls among the trees. If he did, he didn&#x2019;t show it. More likely, he knew those sounds as well as those of the town.</p><p>The dark, small form was lighter of foot than almost anyone else.</p><p>&#x201c;So&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. where&#x2019;s that husband of yours?&#x201d; he asked wryly without stirring.</p><p>The short one among the deeper dark of the trees halted with a sigh.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Father!&#x201d; she whispered in exasperation. &#x201c;One day, I <i>will</i> sneak up on you.&#x201d;</p><p>He laughed, though it was a tired sound. &#x201c;Not in this life, my little wild one.&#x201d;</p><p>When she stepped nearer out of the trees, she was no more than a shadow, indistinct in a long robe and deep cowl. The closer she came, the more the light showed her sage&#x2019;s robe of deep forest green. That in itself was strange, since no known order of sages wore that color.</p><p>Inside the cowl&#x2019;s depths, twilight might have sparked a more brilliant, verdant green in her large, almond-shaped eyes. Those eyes were not unlike his, though his were the more traditional amber of their people. She slowed to a stop a few steps off and behind on his right, and he still stared out across the waters.</p><p>&#x201c;I came as soon as I received your message,&#x201d; the daughter said softly, taking another step. &#x201c;You did not go with Mother&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to see <i>her.</i>&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No point,&#x201d; her father answered with a slight shake of his head. &#x201c;<i>She&#x2019;s</i> already gone by now, and so your mother was enough.&#x201d;</p><p>Silence lingered briefly.</p><p>&#x201c;You did not want to go?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I did!&#x201d;</p><p>Finally, he glanced away from the light upon the water, but he still didn&#x2019;t look up at her. She felt his sadness, for she shared it for the one who had passed away. Too short a life had ended, even for a human woman, an old friend to them all.</p><p>The daughter looked closely at her father&#x2019;s sad and coldly angry profile. Even in the dark, she saw the lines of age on his face.</p><p>&#x201c;At least she was happy again, for a while,&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give <i>him</i> that, and she deserved it.&#x201d;</p><p>Another long silence, and then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;She was your friend as well as Mother&#x2019;s,&#x201d; the daughter insisted. &#x201c;You should have gone. I would have, but I thought to come here first.&#x201d;</p><p>At first, he didn&#x2019;t answer. &#x201c;Your mother needed to go alone this time,&#x201d; he said quietly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the last time. And you don&#x2019;t know everything&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. about how it might end.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Ghassan il&#x2019;S�nke was powerless to stop the motion of his legs. He strode down the darkened streets of Samau&#x2019;a Gaulb, the main port city of il&#x2019;Dha&#x2019;ab Najuum, the imperial city of the Suman Empire. Trying to exert his will for perhaps the hundredth time, he screamed out with his thoughts, for even his voice was not his to command.</p><p><i>Stop!</i></p><p>As always, it had no effect.</p><p>Trapped, he was merely a passenger&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a prisoner within his own flesh taken over by a thousand-year-old specter.</p><p>Khalidah now ruled his flesh.</p><p>Ghassan&#x2019;s body walked past people on the street who barely glanced his way. To them, he would appear mundane. Beneath the hood of a faded open-front robe, his short chocolate-colored hair with flecks of silver was in disarray. Strands dangled to his thick brows above eyes separated by a straight but overly prominent nose. Though he had once worn the midnight blue robe of a sage in the order of Metaology, now his borrowed clothing&#x2014;a dusky linen shirt and drab pantaloons&#x2014;was no different from that of a common street vendor.</p><p>His body turned into a side alley. His head swiveled as he&#x2014;as Khalidah&#x2014;looked around.</p><p>Spotting several barrels halfway down the shadowed alley, he went and crouched down beside them. His left hand reached inside his shirt, and his fingers gripped the chain of a medallion, which he drew out. Panic&#x2014;no, terror&#x2014;flooded him, and he screamed out again.</p><p><i>No!</i></p><p>&#x201c;Buzz, you little brain fly,&#x201d; Khalidah whispered with the domin&#x2019;s own voice, and then came the command, cutting like a knife in only thought. <i>Be silent!</i></p><p>Everything before Ghassan&#x2019;s mind&#x2019;s eye went black with pain. He felt the specter squeeze the medallion and focus his will to make the connection to the one other who carried such a medallion. All Ghassan could do was listen.</p><p><i>My prince&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my emperor, are you there?</i></p><p>Ghassan heard the answer, another cruelty of awareness dealt by his captor.</p><p><i>Yes, Ghassan. I am here.</i></p><p>Ghassan&#x2019;s impotence smothered his pain in despair; he was trapped in the prison of his own mind and unable to protect his prince.</p><p>The former imperial prince, Ounyal&#x2019;am, had been elevated to emperor pending his coronation. Still, and as always, he trusted very few people. He trusted Ghassan almost absolutely, and Ghassan had taught him long ago how to use the medallion so they could communicate in the secrecy of thought from a distance.</p><p>Ounyal&#x2019;am was likely in his private chambers, believing he conversed with his mentor. Instead, he touched thoughts with the thousand-year-old specter of the first sorcerer to walk the world.</p><p>Ghassan struggled for one instant of control over his flesh&#x2014;and he failed again against the will of Khalidah. He would have wept in the dark if he could have as his prince&#x2014;his emperor-to-be&#x2014;asked&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p><i>Is all well, domin?</i></p><p>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�</p><p>Gripping the medallion, Khalidah exerted more of his will to suppress Ghassan il&#x2019;S�nke. That it took a little effort surprised him, but only for a passing thought. Of any body he had ever inhabited, he had never been forced to work at all to keep its original inhabitant trapped.</p><p>Still, taking il&#x2019;S�nke had been a great blessing, for the renegade domin possessed the trust&#x2014;the friendship&#x2014;of the emperor-to-be. And he answered back while still allowing the domin to hear.</p><p><i>Yes, my emperor&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. simply busy. And what of you?</i></p><p>Ounyal&#x2019;am&#x2019;s answer took a moment.</p><p><i>Funeral arrangements for my father have been finalized. The palace is overrun with nobles and royals. I did not think court plots would ever become so thick&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and open.</i></p><p>Khalidah had seen the result of the impending funeral in the city as well. Many areas had become overcrowded. Temporary housing had grown scarce.</p><p><i>And your coronation plans&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and wedding? </i>he ventured.</p><p>Another moment&#x2019;s hesitation passed. <i>Both progress, but there has been some upheaval since I announced my chosen bride.</i></p><p>Well, the young fool should have expected that. A&#x2019;ish&#x2019;ah, daughter of the general and emir Mansoor, was too cripplingly shy to fit the role of first empress. Worse, the most powerful families of the empire had all vied to place their own daughters at the side of Ounyal&#x2019;am. His announcement must have come as quite a slap to their faces.</p><p>Of course there would be a backlash.</p><p>Khalidah had no interest in whomever Ounyal&#x2019;am married and had asked only because il&#x2019;S�nke would have. The new emperor&#x2019;s trust must be maintained as a potential resource. Now it was time to press on to matters of more interest.</p><p><i>After recent events, </i>Khalidah began,<i> have restrictions on movement out of the city been eased?</i></p><p><i>Yes, as other matters have taken precedence.</i></p><p><i>Have any reports of concern come from other parts of the empire, perhaps from the eastern desert?</i></p><p><i>No&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. why? Is there something to be concerned about?</i></p><p>With a quick twinge, Khalidah grew cautious. Had he gone too far&#x2014;been too specific&#x2014;in his questions?</p><p><i>Like the captain of your private guard, I have always feared an assassination attempt. More so now before your pending coronation. Your death is the only way left for others to wrest authority over the empire. I protect you from without as your bodyguards protect you within the palace walls.</i></p><p><i>Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yes, of course. But no, I have not received reports of interest since my father&#x2019;s death.</i></p><p><i>Very good. </i>And then Khalidah considered another ploy, to keep Ounyal&#x2019;am not only ever dependent but also useful.<i> But too little news can be a warning. An empire that is suddenly quiet is one to watch closely for the slightest oddity. I will be in contact again soon&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my emperor.</i></p><p><i>Good night, Ghassan.</i></p><p>The medallion cooled in Khalidah&#x2019;s grip as he rose, dropped it inside his shirt, and strode toward the alley&#x2019;s open end. It was time to return to Ghassan il&#x2019;S�nke&#x2019;s hidden &#x201c;sanctuary&#x201d; shielded from all senses by the ensorcellments of the domin&#x2019;s eradicated sect. There hid a collection of people equally useful.</p><p>Magiere, the dhampir, rested in secret with her half-elven mate, Leesil. There was also a young foreign sage, Wynn Hygeorht, and her own companion, Chane Andraso, a vampire. Then there were two elven males, one young and naive, and the other elderly, able, and disturbingly with a mind that seemed impenetrable so far. There was a mixed-blood girl who was more baggage than anything. But the worst were the two nonhuman, nonelven <i>creatures</i> among the others.</p><p>The pair of majay-h�&#x2014;Fay-descended wolves&#x2014;had yet to sense Khalidah, likely because of the living flesh he inhabited. He had seen their kind begin to appear near the end of the war a thousand years ago.</p><p>Still, Khalidah almost could not believe his twisted fortune and thought it was not all luck. In the end, it was a great opportunity.</p><p>This group had attempted to kill him, and that unto itself was amusing. They believed they had succeeded, never suspecting that he had fled his previous host before death for the flesh of Ghassan il&#x2019;S�nke. Even if they ever doubted his destruction, he was in the last possible host they would think vulnerable to &#x201c;the specter.&#x201d;</p><p>Khalidah felt il&#x2019;S�nke thrash against his greater will, which was all the more satisfying. Of course, he should not chuckle to himself while walking the streets. It would look odd.</p><p>The domin&#x2019;s assembled group had to be controlled&#x2014;guided&#x2014;in their task of gathering his god&#x2019;s greatest treasures: the anchors of creation.</p><p>One each for the five metaphysical elements, they were now merely called &#x201c;orbs.&#x201d; These powerful devices had been created more than a thousand years ago by a god with too many names.</p><p><i>F�hmon</i>, the Foe or Enemy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>K�rav�gh</i>, the Nightfallen&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>Keiron</i>, the Black One&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>in&#x2019;Sa&#x2019;umar&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </i>the words in the dark&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>il&#x2019;Samar</i>, the Night Voice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>No, perhaps not names but titles. Even more had come and gone to be forgotten by most, but he remembered them all. And the last held the false affection of a slave&#x2019;s eternal fear of his master.</p><p><i>Hk�b�v&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </i>Loved One&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Beloved.</p><p>That title made him burn inside. Even true love betrayed countless times could become hatred equally passionate.</p><p>Centuries ago, Beloved had lost a great war upon the world and retreated into a hidden and dark dormancy. Now this god had awakened, calling its servants&#x2014;slaves&#x2014;to regather its prime tools, the &#x201c;orbs.&#x201d;</p><p>Khalidah clenched his hands&#x2014;il&#x2019;S�nke&#x2019;s hands&#x2014;as he quickened his pace. He would bring the orbs to Beloved&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but not as his god wished.</p><p>Now deep into the capital&#x2019;s east side, he turned down a dark, lampless side street past three shabby buildings and stopped before the fourth&#x2019;s crooked door. Its once-turquoise paint was pale and peeling. So many cracks had spread over so many years of heat and dry wind that they were visible in the dark.</p><p>In this decrepit tenement&#x2019;s top floor was a set of hidden rooms where il&#x2019;S�nke had given sanctuary to Magiere and the others. The place had been ensorcelled by the domin&#x2019;s sect of sorcerers among the metaologers of the Guild of Sagecraft&#x2019;s Suman branch. The same sect had kept Khalidah imprisoned for more than a century before he escaped and killed all but Ghassan il&#x2019;S�nke. They had a few other such places throughout the capital and even in other cities of the empire. If he chose to walk up to the top floor, at the end of its passage he would face the phantasm of a window&#x2014;that was actually a secret door.</p><p>Though the window appeared and felt quite real, the scant number of people who knew the truth might explain it as an illusion. Khalidah knew this was not the case, as there was no &#x201c;illusion&#x201d; to be dismissed. A phantasm lived&#x2014;became real&#x2014;to the senses of whomever it affected. And all were affected when the passage&#x2019;s end came into their awareness, their sight, or even just their touch, should that place be too dark at night to see clearly. Only several small pebbles ensorcelled by the sect allowed a bearer to experience, touch, and open the door that was hidden there.</p><p>Khalidah remained in the street, staring at the crooked, bleached, and peeling front door. With a blink, he slipped into a cutway between the buildings and entered the alley behind the tenement. In another blink, the dark behind his eyelids filled with lines of spreading light.</p><p>A double square, formed in sigils, symbols, and signs, burned brightly; then came a triangle within the square and another triangle inverted within the first. As his eyes&#x2014;il&#x2019;S�nke&#x2019;s eyes&#x2014;winked open, his incantation in thought finished faster than a catch of breath.</p><p>Khalidah&#x2019;s hearing magnified instantly.</p><p>A few blocks away, he heard a scratchy-voiced woman berating a monger for trying to cheat her over a jar of olives. Though distant, many footfalls, mewling mules, goats, and haggling and bargaining accosted his heightened hearing. He shut all of this out, and then heard a thundering buzz nearby.</p><p>A fly swarmed too near him.</p><p>With a flash of a fingertip, he killed it without looking, but what he could not hear irritated him even more. Yes, he heard voice...</p></p><h2>American Houses: A Field Guide to the Architecture of the Home</h2><p>A definitive overview of American domestic architecture ranges from the domiciles of Native American cultures and early colonial structures to the present day, analyzing the cultural, geographical, and historical origins of each style; describing the construction methods involved and the link between form and functions; and examining both interior floor plans and exterior views. Simultaneous.</p><p>Formerly vice president and partner of the Architects Collaborative, the famous firm founded by Walter Gropius, Gerald Foster has taught at the Harvard Graduate School of Design and the Boston Architectural Center as well as the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. His paintings and drawings have been exhibited at the DeCordova Museum and at various galleries. His books include A Field Guide to Airplanes, A Field Guide to Trains, and American Houses: A Field Guide.While the U.S. boasts many great public buildings, designed by architects both homegrown and imported, Foster's operating premise is that most of America's vital and expressive architectural tradition has been a domestic one. The great breadth of this tradition&#x2014;from Monticello through "Early Louisiana Shotgun" to Frank Lloyd Wright&#x2014;is immaculately and exhaustively described by Foster, a teacher and former partner of Walter Gropius's Architects Collaborative. The book's three extensive sections ("Colonial Traditions," "19th-Century Styles" and "20th-Century Revivals and Innovations") offer not only a visual primer on virtually every important strain of American home building but also extensive and useful annotation on their social and aesthetic backgrounds. The author's numerous drawings are models of clarity. It is useful to have the characteristics of such familiar styles as Gothic Revival and Mission so clearly delineated, and less well-known styles are amply explored. The author of two previous Field Guides, on trains and airplanes, Foster clearly intends this book to be used rather than consulted, to be thrown in the car or jammed in a shoulder bag rather than put on a shelf. While Foster is no Tom Wolfe&#x2013;style polemicist, he is not afraid to be critical when it aids understanding. And more through implication than direct statement, Foster considers the vernacular tradition he describes as belonging to a quickly receding past, one that this book will do much to help preserve. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Dr. Baer has appeared on over 800 radio shows, and lectures at Unity churches around the country.This self-help book is written by an ophthalmologist who uses his personal experience of recovery from divorce and drug addiction to chart a course for others to learn how to find real love in heterosexual marriage. By "real love," Baer means love that is given unconditionally, and he describes many situations that may look like love but are only "imitation" in that it has conditions or strings attached. He also characterizes the many behaviors that people use either to get love or to protect themselves from lack of real love. Unfortunately, his reasoning often seems circular and simplistic, and there are areas where his judgment can be challenged: his discussion of anorexia is not supported by current psychological theory, and his brief discussion of abusive situations could be dangerously misconstrued to lead a victim to stay in a violent relationship. Finally, there are no notes or bibliography. Although the author is popular on the lecture circuit and radio, there is enough questionable material here to withhold a recommendation. Many better books on relationships are available.<br><i>Margaret Cardwell, Christian Brothers Univ., Memphis, TN </i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Last Duel: A True Story of Trial by Combat in Medieval France</h2><p><p><i>As the huge crowd seethed with pent-up excitement, the two deadly enemies studied each other intently, their breath hot behind their visors.

The dramatic true story of the knight, the squire, and the lady unfolds during the devastating Hundred Years War between France and England, as enemy troops pillage the land, madness haunts the French court, the Great Schism splits the Church, Muslim armies threaten Christendom, and rebellion, treachery, and plague turn the lives of all into toys of Fortune.<br>At the heart of the tale is Jean de Carrouges, a Norman knight who returns from combat in Scotland to find his wife, Marguerite, accusing Jacques LeGris, her husband&#x2019;s old friend and fellow courtier, of brutally raping her. The knight takes his cause before the teenage King Charles VI, the highest judge in France. Amid LeGris&#x2019;s vociferous claims of innocence and doubts about the now pregnant Marguerite&#x2019;s charges (and about the paternity of her child), the deadlocked court decrees a &#x201c;trial by combat&#x201d; that leaves her fate, too, in the balance. For if her husband and champion loses the duel, she will be put to death as a false accuser. <br>Carrouges and LeGris, in full armor, eventually meet on a walled field in Paris before a massive crowd that includes the king and many nobles of the realm. A fierce fight on horseback and then on foot ensues during which both combatants suffer wounds&#x2014;but only one fatal. The violent and tragic episode was notorious in its own time because of the nature of the alleged crime, the legal impasse it provoked, and the resulting trial by combat, an ancient but increasingly suspect institution that was thereafter abolished. <br>Based on extensive research in Normandy and Paris, <i>The Last Duel </i>brings to life a colorful, turbulent age and three unforgettable characters caught in a fatal triangle of crime, scandal, and revenge. It is at once a moving human drama, a captivating detective story, and an engrossing work of historical intrigue.</p></p><p><p>ERIC JAGER holds a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan and has also taught at Columbia University.

Asia, Africa, and the still-undiscovered Americas had not yet been colonized by Europeans. And Europe itself had been nearly conquered by Muslim horsemen, who stormed out of Arabia in the seventh century, sailed from Africa to capture Sicily and Spain, and crossed swords with Christians as far north as Tours, France, before being turned back. By the fourteenth century, Christendom had faced the Muslim threat for more than six hundred years, launching repeated crusades against the infidel.<br><br>When not united against its common foe, Christendom was often at war with itself. The kings and queens of Europe, a large extended family of brothers and sisters and intermarried cousins, squabbled and fought with one another continually over thrones and territory. The frequent wars among Europe's feuding monarchs reduced towns and farmland to smoking ruins, killed or starved the people, and left rulers with huge debts that they paid by raising taxes, debasing the coinage, or simply seizing the wealth of convenient victims like Jews.<br><br>At the center of Europe lay the Kingdom of France, a vast realm that took twenty-two days to cross from north to south, and sixteen days from east to west. France, the forge of feudalism, had endured for nearly ten centuries. Founded amid the ruins of Roman Gaul in the fifth century, it had been Charlemagne's fortress against Islamic Spain in the ninth, and it was Europe's richest, most powerful nation at the start of the fourteenth. But within a few decades Fortune had turned against France, and the nation was now desperately fighting for its survival.<br><br>In 1339 the English crossed the Channel and invaded France, beginning the long, ruinous conflict that would be known as the Hundred Years' War. After cutting down the flower of French chivalry at Crecy in 1346, the English captured Calais. A decade later at Poitiers, amid another great slaughter of French knights, the English seized King Jean and took him to London, releasing their royal prisoner only in exchange for vast French territories, many noble hostages, and promises to pay a colossal ransom of three million gold <i>�cus</i>.<br><br>Stunned by the loss of its king and what it cost to buy him back, France fell into civil war. Rebellious nobles betrayed King Jean and joined with the English invaders, peasants enraged by new taxes rose up to murder their lords, and the volatile citizens of Paris split into feuding factions and butchered one another in the streets. Chronic droughts and crop failures added to the misery of the people. And the Great Plague that carried off a third of Europe in 1348-49, leaving unburied corpses scattered over fields and stacked in the streets, kept returning every decade or so for another grim harvest.<br><br>As Death stalked the land, pictured by artists of the time as a shrouded skeleton wielding a great scythe, and as black warning flags flew from belfries in plague-stricken villages, God Himself seemed to have abandoned France. When the Great Schism shook Europe in 1378, dividing Christendom into two warring camps led by rival popes in Rome and Avignon, the Roman pope blessed England's cruel and mercenary war of conquest in France, as English clerics preached a new "crusade" and sold indulgences to finance the slaughter of French "heretics."<br><br>Conquering English armies were followed into France by criminals and outlaws from all over Europe, bands of savage men known as <i>routiers</i>, or "the scourge of God," who roamed the countryside looting towns and villages and extorting tribute from the terrorized people. Amid the violence and the anarchy, France threw itself into a frenzy of fortification. Frightened villagers built earthen walls and dug defensive ditches. Desperate farmers surrounded their houses and barns with stone towers and water-filled moats. Towns and monasteries raised and thickened their walls. Churches were fortified until they resembled castles.<br><br>The bloodlust of war and the crusading spirit kindled by the Great Schism led to many atrocities. Not even nunneries were sacred. In July 1380 English troops mounted a brutal raid on Brittany during which they "stormed a convent and raped and tortured the nuns, carrying off some of the unfortunate women to amuse them for the rest of the raid."<br>In the autumn of 1380 King Charles V died, leaving the realm to his eleven-year-old son, Charles VI. France was then just two-thirds its modern size and less a unified nation than a loose patchwork of separate fiefdoms. Large territories were held by the young king's five jealous uncles, who had been appointed regents during his minority; others were occupied by enemy troops. Burgundy belonged to Philip the Bold, the most powerful royal uncle and founder of a dynasty that soon would rival France itself. Anjou belonged to another royal uncle, Duke Louis. Provence was a separate county, not yet part of France, and parts of Guyenne were held by the English. Brittany was a nearly independent dukedom, while Normandy was also infested by the English, who used it to launch raids on the rest of France, recruiting many renegade Normans to their cause. The strategic port of Calais, long an English stronghold bristling with men and arms, was pointed like a dagger at the nation's heart, Paris.<br><br>Surrounded by rivals and enemies, the boy-king in theory ruled over about ten million people. His subjects belonged to three main estates or social classes--warriors, priests, and laborers, or "those who fight, those who pray, and those who work." The vast majority were laborers, some of whom lived in towns where they kept shops, but most of whom were peasants or <i>villeins</i>, farming the manorial estates of their local lords or <i>seigneurs</i>. In exchange for protection in time of war and a strip of land for their own use, they plowed and harvested their lord's fields, cut firewood for his hearth, and yielded up shares of produce and livestock. Bound to the land from birth, they spoke local dialects, lived by provincial customs, and had next to no sense of national identity.<br><br>As the peasant served his lord, so the lord in turn served his overlord. The minor lord might be a knight holding a fief or two, the greater lord a count or a duke with many fiefs--lands held in exchange for service. A vassal--any man sworn to serve another--bound himself to his lord by the act of homage and the oath of fealty.* The vassal knelt with his hands clasped between his lord's, saying, "Lord, I become your man." Then he rose, received a kiss on the mouth, and swore to serve his lord for life. These rituals cemented the mutual bonds holding society together.<br><br>The lifelong bond between lord and vassal was based chiefly on land. As feudal law decreed, "No lord without land; no land without a lord." Land yielded life-sustaining crops as well as lucrative rents, in either coin or kind, along with levies of mail-fisted knights and men-at-arms. Land was thus the feudal nobility's main source of wealth, power, and prestige--and the most enduring thing a man could pass down, with the family name, to his heirs. Valuable and coveted, land was also the cause of many quarrels and deadly feuds.<br>Nowhere did men fight over land more fiercely than in Normandy, a bloody crossroads of war since antiquity. The Celts had fought the Romans there; the Romans, the Franks; and the Franks, the Vikings, before the French and the English clashed there during the Hundred Years' War. The Vikings--or Northmen, <i>Normanni</i>--had eventually settled, taking Frankish land and wives and turning themselves into French-speaking Normans. The dukes of Normandy, a line founded in 911, became vassals to the kings of France.<br><br>In 1066 Duke William of Normandy crossed the Channel with an army of knights, fought and defeated King Harold at the Battle of Hastings, crowned himself king of England, and became known to history as William the Conqueror. As king of England, the Duke of Normandy now rivaled the king of France. For the next century and a half Normandy, with its prosperous towns and wealthy monasteries, remained a possession of the English crown.<br><br>In the early 1200s the king of France won most of Normandy back from the king of England in a hard-fought campaign. But English kings, being of Norman blood, still dreamed of Normandy. And many of Normandy's great families, Normans before they were French, kept an opportunistic eye toward England, always sniffing the air for winds of change.<br><br>When the Hundred Years' War began, and the English started reconquering Normandy, many Norman nobles betrayed the French king and allied themselves with the English invaders.<br>The loyal Normans who swore fealty to the young King Charles in 1380 included an old noble family by the name of Carrouges. Sir Jean de Carrouges III, by then in his sixties, had come of age near the start of the Hundred Years' War and fought in many campaigns against the English. The knight was a vassal to the Count of Perche, who had appointed him the military captain of Bell�me, an important and coveted castle. He was also Viscount of Bell�me, the king's local official--equivalent to an English shire reeve, or sheriff. In 1364 he had helped raise money for King Jean's ransom. The respected knight was married to Nicole de Buchard, a well-born lady with whom he had at least three children. The family's ancestral home was the fortified hilltop town of Carrouges, about fifteen miles northwest of Alen�on.<br><br>According to legend, the Carrouges line was born of blood and violence. One story tells of an ancestor named Count Ralph who fell in love with a sorceress and kept trysts with her near a fountain in a forest glade, until one night his jealous wife surprised the two lovers there with a dagger. The...</p><h2>Some Horses</h2><p>A collection of eight essays from renowned horse enthusiast and acclaimed writer Thomas McGuane examines the various personalities and traits of different breeds of horses, and explores the deep bond forged between horses and humans.</p><p>Since his arrival as a novelist and essayist in the late 1960s, Thomas McGuane's elegant and muscular prose has left its print on the trail of American letters, exploring the American landscape and exposing the American heart. In the nine finely tooled essays that make up <i>Some Horses</i>, McGuane explores and exposes his own passionately layered relationship to the cutting horses he rides and works on his Montana ranch. The author's admiration for his four-legged characters is displayed with perceptive wit and clear affection: "If a horse were a Ford," he suggests, "the species would vanish beneath lawsuits engendered by consumer-protection laws." As both participant and observer, McGuane makes sure his readers feel the unique intimacy of the man-horse relationship. "We have saturated the horse with our emotions," he writes. "Yet, a lover of horses has nothing to prove and no expertise to reveal. It is important that we find animals to love, and that is the end of the story." <p> Actually, for McGuane it's just the beginning. Moving with introspection and grace, he kicks up plenty of dust, description, and insight in essays that probe the intricacies of riding horses, working horses, caring for horses, breeding horses, and competing on them in the roping and displays he so loves. In the magical "A Foal," he contrasts the anxiety of a favorite mare's overdue pregnancy with the joy that finally attends the successful introduction of a healthy newborn into the fold. Also scattered through the collection are marvelous insights into the writer's life--and, in one particular passage, the hands that have produced his life's work: "I looked at my hand, crooked thumb, rope burns, enlarged knuckles, and I felt good because I'd always been afraid that, as a writer, I would always have these Ivory Snow hands." But it's the <i>bigger</i> picture that ultimately interests McGuane: "The open range, the open sea, the open sky, the open wounds of the heart, that's where writers shine." McGuane shines on every page. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>Tom McGuane loves horses. Nowhere is that more evident than in his deft and utterly fascinating essays about some of the more remarkable horses and horsemen he has known.In these nine essays, he examines the relationship between horses and humans: what it is about horses that reveals so much about ourselves, what we see in them, why they respond to us, and the symbiosis that can result from such a match. Whether he is writing about cutting horses, learning to rope, or the birth of a foal, McGuane's passion finds expression in his extraordinary talent.

The brilliant, breathtaking conclusion to J.K. Rowling's spellbinding series is not for the faint of heart--such revelations, battles, and betrayals await in <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i> that no fan will make it to the end unscathed. Luckily, Rowling has prepped loyal readers for the end of her series by doling out increasingly dark and dangerous tales of magic and mystery, shot through with lessons about honor and contempt, love and loss, and right and wrong. Fear not, you will find no spoilers in our review--to tell the plot would ruin the journey, and <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i> is an odyssey the likes of which Rowling's fans have not yet seen, and are not likely to forget. But we would be remiss if we did not offer one small suggestion before you embark on your final adventure with Harry--bring plenty of tissues. <p> The heart of Book 7 is a hero's mission--not just in Harry's quest for the Horcruxes, but in his journey from boy to man--and Harry faces more danger than that found in all six books combined, from the direct threat of the Death Eaters and you-know-who, to the subtle perils of losing faith in himself. Attentive readers would do well to remember Dumbledore's warning about making the choice between "what is right and what is easy," and know that Rowling applies the same difficult principle to the conclusion of her series. While fans will find the answers to hotly speculated questions about Dumbledore, Snape, and you-know-who, it is a testament to Rowling's skill as a storyteller that even the most astute and careful reader will be taken by surprise. </p><p> A spectacular finish to a phenomenal series, <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i> is a bittersweet read for fans. The journey is hard, filled with events both tragic and triumphant, the battlefield littered with the bodies of the dearest and despised, but the final chapter is as brilliant and blinding as a phoenix's flame, and fans and skeptics alike will emerge from the confines of the story with full but heavy hearts, giddy and grateful for the experience. <i>--Daphne Durham</i> </p><p> <strong>Deluxe Edition Details</strong> <br>The Deluxe Edition includes an exclusive insert featuring near-scale reproductions of Mary GrandPr�'s interior art, as well as never-before-seen full-color frontispiece art on special paper.

Readers learn how much the Dursleys have been keeping from Harry. Rowling does a wonderful job in displaying the lengths to which Uncle Vernon will go to deny that magic exists. <br>* Harry's first visit to Diagon Alley with Hagrid. Full of curiosities and rich with magic and marvel, Harry's first trip includes a trip to Gringotts and Ollivanders, where Harry gets his wand (holly and phoenix feather) and discovers yet another connection to He-Who-Must-No-Be-Named. This moment is the reader's first full introduction to Rowling's world of witchcraft and wizards.<br>* Harry's experience with the Sorting Hat. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i></strong> <br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td>* The de-gnoming of the Weasleys' garden. Harry discovers that even wizards have chores--gnomes must be grabbed (ignoring angry protests "Gerroff me! Gerroff me!"), swung about (to make them too dizzy to come back), and tossed out of the garden--this delightful scene highlights Rowling's clever and witty genius. <br>* Harry's first experience with a Howler, sent to Ron by his mother. <br>* The Dueling Club battle between Harry and Malfoy. Gilderoy Lockhart starts the Dueling Club to help students practice spells on each other, but he is not prepared for the intensity of the animosity between Harry and Draco. Since they are still young, their minibattle is innocent enough, including tickling and dancing charms. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i></strong><br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td>* Ron's attempt to use a telephone to call Harry at the Dursleys'. <br>* Harry's first encounter with a Dementor on the train (and just about any other encounter with Dementors). Harry's brush with the Dementors is terrifying and prepares Potter fans for a darker, scarier book. <br>* Harry, Ron, and Hermione's behavior in Professor Trelawney's Divination class. Some of the best moments in Rowling's books occur when she reminds us that the wizards-in-training at Hogwarts are, after all, just children. Clearly, even at a school of witchcraft and wizardry, classes can be boring and seem pointless to children. <br>* The Boggart lesson in Professor Lupin's classroom. <br>* Harry, Ron, and Hermione's knock-down confrontation with Snape. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i></strong><br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td>* Hermione's disgust at the reception for the veela (Bulgarian National Team Mascots) at the Quidditch World Cup. Rowling's fourth book addresses issues about growing up--the dynamic between the boys and girls at Hogwarts starts to change. Nowhere is this more plain than the hilarious scene in which magical cheerleaders nearly convince Harry and Ron to jump from the stands to impress them. <br>* Viktor Krum's crush on Hermione--and Ron's objection to it. <br>* Malfoy's "Potter Stinks" badge. <br>* Hermione's creation of S.P.E.W., the intolerant bigotry of the Death Eaters, and the danger of the Triwizard Tournament. Add in the changing dynamics between girls and boys at Hogwarts, and suddenly Rowling's fourth book has a weight and seriousness not as present in early books in the series. Candy and tickle spells are left behind as the students tackle darker, more serious issues and take on larger responsibilities, including the knowledge of illegal curses.</td></tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i></strong><br> </p><p> </p><table> <tbody><tr><td> </td> <td>* Harry's outburst to his friends at No. 12 Grimmauld Place. A combination of frustration over being kept in the dark and fear that he will be expelled fuels much of Harry's anger, and it all comes out at once, directly aimed at Ron and Hermione. Rowling perfectly portrays Harry's frustration at being too old to shirk responsibility, but too young to be accepted as part of the fight that he knows is coming. <br>* Harry's detention with Professor Umbridge. Rowling shows her darker side, leading readers to believe that Hogwarts is no longer a safe haven for young wizards. Dolores represents a bureaucratic tyrant capable of real evil, and Harry is forced to endure their private battle of wills alone. <br>* Harry and Cho's painfully awkward interactions. Rowling clearly remembers what it was like to be a teenager. <br>* Harry's Occlumency lessons with Snape. <br>* Dumbledore's confession to Harry.</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> </p><p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i></strong><br> </p><p> </p><table> <tbody><tr><td> </td> <td>* The introduction of the Horcrux. <br>* Molly Weasley asking Arthur Weasley about his "dearest ambition." Rowling has always been great at revealing little intriguing bits about her characters at a time, and Arthur&#x2019;s answer "to find out how airplanes stay up" reminds us about his obsession with Muggles.<br>* Harry's private lessons with Dumbledore, and more time spent with the fascinating and dangerous pensieve, arguably one of Rowling&#x2019;s most ingenious inventions.<br>* Fred and George Weasley&#x2019;s Joke Shop, and the slogan: "Why Are You Worrying About You-Know-Who? You Should Be Worrying About U-NO-POO--the Constipation Sensation That's Gripping the Nation!"<br>* Luna's Quidditch commentary.

Ramage returns to the Tuscan coast, where Bonaparte holds a group of hostages for an unknown fate.</p><p>Dudley Pope is well known, both as the creator of the Ramage novels and as a distinguished naval historian. Pope falsified his age in order to enlist in the British Merchant Navy during World War II. In action, his ship was torpedoed and he spent 14 days at sea in an open lifeboat. After being discharged due to the injuries he received, he worked as the naval and defense correspondent at the <i>London Daily News</i>. He turned to writing fiction at the urging of C. S. Forester, who viewed Pope as his creative heir. Author of ten scholarly works as well as the 18 books in the Ramage series, Dudley Pope died in 1997.Dudley Bernard Egerton Pope was born in 1925 into an ancient Cornish seafaring family. He joined the Merchant Navy at the age of sixteen and spent much of his early life at sea. He was torpedoed during the Second World War and resulting spinal injuries plagued him for the rest of his life. Towards the end of the war Pope turned to journalism, becoming the Naval and Defence Correspondent for the &#39;London Evening News&#39;. At this time he also researched naval history and in time became an authority on the Napoleonic era and Nelson&#39;s exploits, resulting in several well received volumes, especially on the Battles of Copenhagen and Trafalgar. Encouraged by Hornblower creator CS Forester, he also began writing fiction using his own experiences in the Navy and his extensive historical research as a basis. In 1965, he wrote &#39;Ramage&#39;, the first of his highly successful series of novels following the exploits of the heroic &#39;Lord Nicholas Ramage&#39; during the Napoleonic Wars. Another renowned series is centred on &#39;Ned Yorke&#39;, a buccaneer in the seventeenth century Caribbean and then with a descendant following the &#39;Yorke&#39; family naval tradition when involved in realistic secret operations during the Second World War. Dudley Pope lived aboard boats whenever possible, along with his wife and daughter, and this was where he wrote the majority of his novels. Most of his adult life was spent in the Caribbean and in addition to using the locale for fictional settings he also wrote authoritatively on naval history of the region, including a biography of the buccaneer Sir Henry Morgan. He died in 1997 aged seventy one. &#39;The first and still favourite rival to Hornblower&#39; - Daily Mirror</p><h2>AVENGERS: Season One Graphic Novel (EXCLUSIVE EDITION) (Avengers)</h2><p>All-new original graphic novel, modernizing the formative first days of these super-hero icons that defined pop culture.</p><p></p><h2>An Artist&#39;s Handbook: Materials and Techniques</h2><p>Every art studio needs a comprehensive guide to drawing and painting materials and how to use them.

With growing racial tension, animosity toward law enforcement professionals, government corruption, and disregard for the constitutional process, there seems to be no easy answer in sight. But Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke knows where we must begin: we must stop blaming others; look at our problems with open eyes; take ownership of our family, community, and country; and turn to God for solutions. Deeply rooted in Sheriff Clarke's personal life story, this book is not a dry recitation of what has gone wrong in America with regard to race. It's about the issues that deeply affect us today-both personally and politically-and how we can rise above our current troubles to once again be a truly great people in pursuit of liberty and justice for all.<br><br> "The principles Sheriff Clarke stands for are the same principles this nation was built on.

Tolkien (1892&#x2013;1973), beloved throughout the world as the creator of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, a fellow of Pembroke College, and a fellow of Merton College until his retirement in 1959. His chief interest was the linguistic aspects of the early English written tradition, but even as he studied these classics he was creating a set of his own.A collection of pieces, 1949-75, that barely touches upon the Middle-Earth scenario for which Tolkien (1829-1973) is justly famous; overall, however, it renders a much more complete account of this scholar, poet, critic, and storyteller's talents. The charming, deceptively light poems of ``The Adventures of Tom Bambadil'' contain intriguing sidelights on Middle-Earth lore, while the dramatic poem ``The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth'' (``unavailable in any other edition,'' according to the publisher), complete with scholarly introduction, describes the aftermath of the Battle of Maldon, which occurred in the year 991. The essay ``On Fairy-Stories'' has won critical acclaim, as have the tales ``Farmer Giles of Ham'' and ``Smith of Wootton Major,'' as well as the story that most closely reflects Tolkien's personal philosophy (``Leaf by Niggle''). Some of these may be familiar, or available individually; still, this collection is a splendid accompaniment for existing fans, or an excellent introduction for newcomers. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Through extensive on-the-record interviews with friends and teachers, mentors and disparagers, family members and Obama himself,<b> </b>David Remnick allows us to see how a rootless, unaccomplished, and confused young man<b> </b>created himself first as a community organizer in Chicago, an<b> </b>experience that would not only shape his urge to work in politics but give him a home and a community, and that would propel him to Harvard Law School, where his sense of a greater mission emerged.<br><br>Deftly setting Obama&#x2019;s political career against the galvanizing intersection of race and politics in Chicago&#x2019;s history, Remnick shows us how that city&#x2019;s complex racial legacy would make Obama&#x2019;s forays into politics a source of controversy and bare-knuckle tactics: his clashes with older black politicians in the Illinois State Senate, his disastrous decision to challenge the former Black Panther Bobby Rush for Congress in 2000, the sex scandals that would decimate his more experienced opponents in the 2004 Senate race, and the story&#x2014;from both sides&#x2014;of his confrontation with his former pastor, Jeremiah Wright.<b> </b>By looking at Obama&#x2019;s political rise through the prism of our racial history, Remnick gives us the conflicting agendas of black politicians: the dilemmas of men like Jesse Jackson, John Lewis, and Joseph Lowery,<b> </b>heroes of the civil rights movement, who are forced to reassess old loyalties and understand the priorities of a new generation of African-American leaders.<br><br><i>The Bridge</i> revisits the American drama of race, from slavery to civil rights, and makes clear how Obama&#x2019;s quest is not just his own but is emblematic of a nation where destiny is defined by individuals keen to imagine a future that is different from the reality of their current lives.</p><p>David Remnick was a reporter for <i>The Washington Post</i> for ten years, including four in Moscow. He joined <i>The New Yorker</i> as a writer in 1992 and has been the magazine&#x2019;s editor since 1998. His last book was <i>King of the World</i>, a biography of Muhammad Ali, which was selected by <i>Time </i>as the top nonfiction book of 1998. <i>Lenin&#x2019;s Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire</i> won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994.Prologue<br><br>The Joshua Generation<br><br><i><br>Brown Chapel<br>Selma, Alabama</i><br><b>This is how it began</b>, the telling of a story that changed America.<br><br>At midday on March 4, 2007, Barack Obama, the junior senator from Illinois, was scheduled to speak at Brown Chapel, in Selma, Alabama. His campaign for President was barely a month old, and he had come South prepared to confront, for the first time, the Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton. He planned to discuss in public what so many believed would ultimately be his undoing&#x2014;his race, his youth, his &#x201c;exotic&#x201d; background. &#x201c;Who is Barack Obama?&#x201d; Barack <i>Hussein </i>Obama? From now until Election Day, his opponents, Democratic and Republican, would ask the question on public platforms, in television and radio commercials, often insinuating a disqualifying otherness about the man: his childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia; his Kenyan father; his Kansas- born, yet cosmopolitan, mother.<br><br>Obama&#x2019;s answer to that question helped form the language and distinctiveness of his campaign. Two years out of the Illinois State Senate and barely free of his college loans, Obama entered the Presidential race with a serious, yet unexceptional, set of center- left policy positions. They were not radically different from Clinton&#x2019;s, save on the crucial question of the Iraq war. Nor did he possess an impressive r�sum� of executive experience or legislative accomplishment. But who Obama was, where he came from, how he came to understand himself, and, ultimately, how he managed to project his own temperament and personality as a reflection of American ambitions and hopes would be at the center of his rhetoric and appeal. In addition to his political views, what Obama proposed as the core of his candidacy was a self&#x2014;a complex, cautious, intelligent, shrewd, young African-American man. He was not a great man yet by any means, but he was the promise of greatness. There, in large measure, was the wellspring of his candidacy, its historical dimension and conceit, and there was no escaping its gall. Obama himself used words like &#x201c;presumptuous&#x201d; and &#x201c;audacious.&#x201d;<br><br>In Selma, Obama prepared to nominate himself as the inheritor of the most painful of all American struggles, the struggle of race: not race as invoked by his predecessors in electoral politics or in the civil- rights movement, not race as an insistence on ethnicity or redress; rather, Obama would make his biracial ancestry a metaphor for his ambition to create a broad coalition of support, to rally Americans behind a narrative of moral and political progress. He was not necessarily the hero of that narrative, but he just might be its culmination. In the months to come, Obama borrowed brazenly from the language and imagery of an epochal American movement and applied it to a campaign for the Presidency.<br><br>The city of Selma clusters around the murky waters of the Alabama River. Selma had been a prosperous manufacturing center and an arsenal for the Confederate Army. Now it is a forlorn place of twenty thousand souls. Broad Street ordinarily lacks all but the most listless human traffic. African Americans live mostly in modest houses, shotgun shacks, and projects on the east side of town; whites tend to live, more prosperously, on the west side.<br><br>Selma&#x2019;s economy experiences a burst of vitality during the annual flowerings of historical memory. The surviving antebellum plantation houses are, for the most part, kept up for the few tourists who still come. In mid- April, Civil War buffs arrive in town to commemorate the Confederate dead in a re- enactment of the Battle of Selma, where, in 1865, a Confederate general, a particularly sadistic racist named Nathan Bedford Forrest, suffered defeat. The blacks in town do not share in the mood of Confederate nostalgia. An almost entirely black housing project just outside of town was, for decades, named for General Forrest, who had traded slaves and became Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.<br><br>After the Civil War, black students came to Selma University, a small Bible college, and the town&#x2014;a town of churches&#x2014;became renowned as a center of African- American preaching. Selma, Ralph Abernathy wrote in his memoirs, &#x201c;was to many of us the &#x2018;Capital of the Black Belt,&#x2019; a place where intelligent young people and learned elders gathered.&#x201d; At the same time, because of the grip of Jim Crow, Selma was, as late as the nineteensixties, a place of literacy tests and poll taxes; almost no blacks were able to register to vote. Surrounded by disdainful white registrars, they were made to answer questions like &#x201c;How many bubbles are there in a bar of soap?&#x201d;<br><br>The local sheriff, Jim Clark, was in the grotesque folkloric mold of Birmingham&#x2019;s Bull Connor; he wore a button reading &#x201c;Never&#x201d; on his uniform and could be relied upon to take the most brutal measures against any sign of anti- segregationist protest&#x2014;which is why, as the civil-rights movement developed, the grassroots leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (S.C.L.C.) made Selma a test case in the struggle for voting rights.<br><br>On January 2, 1965, Martin Luther King, Jr., came to Brown Chapel, a brick citadel of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and told the congregation that Selma had become a &#x201c;symbol of bitter-end resistance to the civil-rights movement in the Deep South.&#x201d; Just as Montgomery had been the focus of the first bus boycotts and the struggle for civil rights and equal access to public facilities, Selma, King and his comrades decided, would be the battleground for voting rights.<br><b>Barack Obama had been invited</b> to Selma more than a month before the anniversary event by his friend John Lewis, a veteran congressman from Atlanta. In his late sixties, portly and bald, Lewis was known around Capitol Hill and in the African-American community less as a legislator than as a popularly elected <i>griot</i>, a moral exemplar and a wizened truthteller of the civil-rights movement. During the long &#x201c;conservative darkness,&#x201d; from the first Reagan inaugural onward, Lewis said, it was especially &#x201c;hard and essential&#x201d; to keep progressive politics alive. &#x201c;And the only way to do that was to keep telling the story,&#x201d; he said.While King was organizing for the S.C.L.C. in Alabama, Lewis had been the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (sncc). Lewis was present at nearly every important march. He was at King&#x2019;s side at the front of countless demonstrations and in meetings with John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson in the Oval Office. He was the youngest&#x2014;and most militant&#x2014;of the many speakers at the March on Washington in 1963; now he was the only one among them still alive. People called John Lewis a hero every day of his life, but now he was feeling quite unheroic, unsure whom to support: the Clintons, who had &#x201c;never disappointed&#x201d; him over the years, or a young and talented man who had introduced himself to the country with a thrilling speech at the 2004 Democratic Convention in Boston. At first, Lewis signaled to Obama that he would be with him, but the Clintons and their circle were appealing to his sense of friendship and loyalty&#x2014;and they were almost as hard to resist as the lure of history. Feeling acute pressure, Lewis promised both the Clintons and Obama that he would soon have &#x201c;an executive session with myself&#x201d; and decide. <br><br>For Lewis, growing up in Pike County, Alabama, Jim Crow was like a familiar but ominous neighbor. As a boy, he wanted to leave so badly that he dreamed of making a wooden bus out of the pine trees that surrounded his family&#x2019;s house and riding it all the way to California. His parents were sharecroppers and he was one of ten children. He wanted to be a preacher, and, to practice, he declaimed sermons to the chickens in the coop in the backyard. He preached to them weekdays and Sundays alike, marrying the roosters and hens, presiding over funerals for the dead. (&#x201c;There was something magical, almost mystical, about that moment when those dozens and dozens of chickens, all wide awake, were looking straight at me, and I was looking back at them, all of us in total, utter silence. It felt very spiritual, almost religious.&#x201d;)<br><br>In 1955, Lewis listened on the radio to a young preacher from Atlanta giving a sermon called &#x201c;Paul&#x2019;s Letter to the American Christians.&#x201d; The preacher, Martin Luther King, Jr., spoke in the voice of the apostle Paul addressing Christians, white Christians, condemning them for a lack of compassion toward their black brothers and sisters. As he listened to the sermon, Lewis wanted to become a minister like Dr. King. Later that year, he joined a movement that started when a department store clerk in Montgomery named Rosa Parks was arrested after she refused to change her seat on the Cleveland Avenue bus. As a seminarian at Troy State, Lewis took workshops in nonviolent resistance and joined the drive to integrate lunch counters and bus- station waiting rooms in Nashville and other Southern towns and cities. He passed out the axioms of Jesus, Gandhi, Thoreau, and King to his fellow demonstrators even as he was being taunted as an agitator, a &#x201c;nigger,&#x201d; a &#x201c;coon,&#x201d; as teenaged thugs flicked lighted cigarettes at his neck. As a Freedom Rider, Lewis was nearly killed at the Greyhound station in Rock Hill, South Carolina. Getting beaten, arrested, and jailed became a kind of routine, his regular service, and, after each incident, he would rest a little, as if all he had done was to put in a decent day&#x2019;s labor:<br>Some of the deepest, most delicious moments of my life were getting out of jail in a place like Americus,&nbsp; or Hattiesburg, or Selma&#x2014; especially Selma&#x2014;and finding my way to the nearest Freedom House, taking a good long shower, putting on a pair of jeans and a fresh shirtand going to some little Dew&nbsp;...</p><h2>Maggie Cassidy</h2><p>Moodily atmospheric, full of verve and energy, &#34;Maggie Cassidy&#34; is Kerouac&#39;s poignant tale of teenage romance in New England. The story of Jack and Maggie, in love with the idea of being in love, looking ahead to marriage with hope and trepidation, is told with touching simplicity. It skillfully captures both the intensity and the ordinariness of adolescent life, with its torments and complications and is a beautiful evocation of growing up in America.</p><p>Jack Kerouac was born in Lowell, Massachusetts in 1922. In 1947, enthused by bebop, the rebel attitude of his friend Neal Cassady, and the throng of hobos, drug addicts and hustlers he encountered in New York, he decided to discover America and hitchhike across the country. His writing was openly autobiographical and he developed a style he referred to as &#39;spontaneous prose&#39; which he used to record the experiences of the Beat Generation. Kerouac wrote a number of hugely influential and popular novels - most famously the international best-seller On the Road. Among his many other novels are Visions of Cody, The Subterraneans, The Dharma Bums and Big Sur. As much as anything, he came to represent a philosophy, a way of life. He died in 1969.</p><h2>Enduring Seeds: Native American Agriculture and Wild Plant Conservation</h2><p>Warns that modern agriculture practices have over-manipulated and genetically streamlined domestic plants and animals, and suggests fostering diversity, safeguarding wild plants, and developing a wide variety of crops for different local conditions</p><p>As biological diversity continues to shrink at an alarming rate, the loss of plant species poses a threat seemingly less visible than the loss of animals but in many ways more critical. In this book, one of America's leading ethnobotanists warns about our loss of natural vegetation and plant diversity while providing insights into traditional Native agricultural practices in the Americas. Gary Paul Nabhan here reveals the rich diversity of plants found in tropical forests and their contribution to modern crops, then tells how this diversity is being lost to agriculture and lumbering. He then relates "local parables" of Native American agriculture--from wild rice in the Great Lakes region to wild gourds in Florida--that convey the urgency of this situation and demonstrate the need for saving the seeds of endangered plants. Nabhan stresses the need for maintaining a wide gene pool, not only for the survival of these species but also for the preservation of genetic strains that can help scientists breed more resilient varieties of other plants. <i>Enduring Seeds</i> is a book that no one concerned with our environment can afford to ignore. It clearly shows us that, as agribusiness increasingly limits the food on our table, a richer harvest can be had by preserving ancient ways. This edition features a new foreword by Miguel Altieri, one of today's leading spokesmen for sustainable agriculture and the preservation of indigenous farming methods.Gary Paul Nabhan is Assistant Director of the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, Arizona and co-founder of Native Seeds/SEARCH. He is the recipient of awards from the MacArthur Foundation and the Pew Program on Conservation and the Environment.</p><h2>SHADOWS OF DEATH (A Dorothy Martin Mystery, 14)</h2><p>Dorothy Martin and her husband, retired Chief Constable Alan Nesbitt, go on a trip to Orkney in Scotland to visit an old friend and see some intriguing Stone Age excavations. They realize there&#x2019;s considerable dissension between the archaeologists and the principal donor for the newest dig, a wealthy and abrasive American.<br><br>When a more recent corpse is found at the dig, various suspects are named, but there&#x2019;s not enough evidence to bring a case against anyone. Dorothy, always sensitive to atmosphere and the undercurrent of tension pervading the project, has become fascinated by the strong aura of the ancient past that pervades Orkney, and she and Alan launch an unofficial investigation into the murder.</p><p><b><i>Modern murder at an archaeological dig - Dorothy Martin investigates . . .</i></b>Jeanne M.

Used books may not include companion materials, may have some shelf wear, may contain highlighting/notes, may not include CDs or access codes. 100% money back guarantee.</p><p>The tragedy of the <i>Titanic</i> has been captured in fiction, nonfiction, music, poetry, cartoons, official judicial inquiry, survivors' recollections, still photography, TV shows, and film; all of the above are covered to some extent in this good and popular book. But few <i>Titanic</i> books match the paintings by Ken Marschall, a specialist on the subject whose work can be found in other books by the ship's discoverer, Robert Ballard, who wrote the introduction here. The photos are notable--including shots of the red-paint-stained iceberg that may have caused the sinking, the pristine ship, the sunken wreck, the people involved in the case--but Marschall's dozens of large-scale paintings really do help to dramatize and explicate moments no camera glimpsed and few eyewitnesses agree upon. <p> There is much to recommend the text, too. You could make a movie just about Second Officer Charles Lightoller, who helped accelerate the lifeboat-launching process, saving lives; stepped off the ship's bridge into the Atlantic; was sucked down into a ventilator taking in water, vainly swimming against its suction; and then got expelled by a blast of air, like a human cannonball in a circus, and landed next to a lifeboat that had been knocked 20 feet clear of the sinking ship's deadly whirlpool by a huge ship's funnel that crashed into the waves nearby. Lightoller was marvelously clever in his courtroom interrogation by an attorney determined to maneuver him into admitting blame for the disaster.</p><p> There is much more history in between the dramatic illustrations, facts both grand and trivial--if you're bent on knowing what actually happened to the dogs aboard, the answer is in this book. Definitely one of the better titles dealing with <i>Titanic</i>. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><p><b>Donald Lynch</b> is a premier historian on the <i>Titanic </i>and a member of the <i>Titanic </i>Historical Society.

Poet, philosopher, and physician, he is known today for both his religious and secular verse, including his famed &#x201c;songs of Zion,&#x201d; and for <i>The Kuzari</i>, an elucidation of Judaism in dialogue form. Hillel Halkin brilliantly evokes the fascinating world of eleventh- and twelfth-century Andalusian Spain in which Halevi lived and discusses the influences that formed him. Relying on the astonishing discoveries of the Cairo Geniza, he pieces together the mystery of Halevi&#x2019;s last days, with its fateful voyage to Palestine, which became a haunting legend.<br>&nbsp;<br>An acclaimed writer and translator, Halkin builds his account of Halevi&#x2019;s life and death on his magnificent translations of Halevi&#x2019;s poems.

We can&#x2019;t say exactly where. It could have been in C�rdoba, or in Granada, or in Seville, or in any of the other towns that the young man passed through and lived in after leaving the Christian north as an adolescent. We can&#x2019;t say exactly when it happened, either. Since the young man was born sometime between 1070 and 1075, we know only that it was toward the end of the eleventh century. This was a time&#x2014; a thousand years after the destruction of the Second Temple, eight hundred years after the redaction of the Mishnah, and five hundred years after the compilation of the Babylonian Talmud&#x2014;in which 90 percent of the world&#x2019;s Jews lived in a Muslim expanse that stretched from the Atlantic coasts of Spain and Morocco to the Indian subcontinent, and from Yemen to the Aral Sea. Andalusia was in the far northwestern corner of this vast territory, pressing against and pressed back on by Christian Europe. It had been a part of the Islamic realm ever since Arab and Berber warriors from North Africa stormed the Straits of Gibraltar in 711 and conquered most of Spain.<br><br>If the night was warm and rainless, as most Andalusian nights are, the young man was probably sitting at a table out-of-doors, in an interior courtyard of the sort still found everywhere in the south of Spain. (What tourist to the region has not seen, on a street of seemingly plain houses, a door swing open and shut on a gardened patio like the tantalizing flash of a secret existence?) Perhaps, if it was springtime, a blossoming orange or lemon tree gave off its sweet-and-sour scent. The young man was unlikely to have been drinking alone, since he was too popular to be left by himself for long. From a neighboring table, an admirer sent a jug of wine. The young man thanked him with a poem. It may have been written afterwards and delivered by a messenger. Yet judging by the young man&#x2019;s gifts and the art of poetic improvisation in Muslim Spain, it was most probably composed on the spot and carried back by the waiter who had brought the wine. It went, in a free English translation:<br><br><i>I shall sing your praise all my days<br><br>For the nectar you sent for my lips.<br><br>Brother Jug joins in my lays,<br><br>And from him I won&#x2019;t cease my sips<br><br>Even though all my friends say, &#x201c;Come, come!<br><br>How much longer will you play the rake?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I&#x2019;ll reply. &#x201c;I have Gilead&#x2019;s balm<br><br>And shan&#x2019;t drink to cure every ache?&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;m too young to put down the cup<br><br>I&#x2019;ve only begun to pick up. To and for<br><br>What end should I stop<br><br>When my years are not yet two and four?</i><br><br>In Hebrew, the language in which this poem was written, the young man&#x2019;s punning avowal that he was under twenty-four (which need not mean he was twenty-three; he could just as well have been sixteen or seventeen) works differently from my English rendition. Traditionally, each of the Hebrew consonants has a numerical value, and the word <i>kad</i>, &#x201c;<i>jug</i>,&#x201d; is composed of the letters <i>kaf</i>, which stands for twenty, and <i>dalet</i>, which stands for four. Literally, then, the poem&#x2019;s last two lines read:<br><br><i>And how can I give up the kad [jug]</i><br><br><i>When my years have not yet reached kad [twentyfour]?</i><br><br>Its pun aside, the young man&#x2019;s poem obeyed complex rules, since not only was the Hebrew verse of his day required to have meter and rhyme, its standards for both were more stringent than those of formal English poetry. Regardless of its length, a poem in the classical style was allowed only a single mono-rhyme, with which each of its lines had to end. When it came to meter, on the other hand, a poet had to choose among a dozen possible patterns, each consisting of a rigidly adhered-to alteration of &#x201c;long&#x201d; and &#x201c;short&#x201d; syllables. For this particular poem, the young man chose the meter, known as the marnin or &#x201c;allegro,&#x201d; short-long-long-long, short-long-long-long, short-long-long, a single sequence of which made up the half-lines or hemistiches into which each of the poem&#x2019;s full lines was divided.<br><br>Dashing off, amid the hubbub of a tavern, a poem so demanding yet wittily accomplished would have been an impressive feat. It would not have ranked, however, as a singular one. Talented poets in Andalusia were expected to do such things. It is told of Shmuel Hanagid (993&#x2013;1056), the first of the great Hispano-Hebrew poets, that he once had quoted to him a couplet on the subject of biting into an apple. Not to be outdone, he proceeded to compose, one after another, fifteen short but perfectly constructed poems on the same theme before running out of time, breath, or inspiration.<br><br>Indeed, if calling an age &#x201c;poetic&#x201d; refers, not to some supposed collective sublimity or imaginativeness of mind, but, more mundanely, to the widespread use of poetry in ordinary life as a medium of communication and social exchange, the young man was born in one of the most historically poetic of ages. When, for instance, the same Shmuel Hanagid decided one spring day in Granada to throw a party for his friends, the invitations he sent out were in the form of a poem telling them to &#x201c;<i>Take note, make haste, and do not fail"/"To gather in my garden</i>.&#x201d; But this would have been only the beginning. Hanagid&#x2019;s invitees might have informed him of their acceptance by sending him a poem in return; some might have turned up at his door with poems as gifts; if there were toasts or speeches, these would have been in poetic form, too; any party games played would have included competitions in which the guests were asked to write a poem on the same theme or having the same formal properties; and a good time having been had, poems would be sent as thank-you notes. It was a world in which, in cultivated circles, no solemn occasion, birth, wedding, or death went without a poem to commemorate it; in which friends wrote each other letters in poetry or, if they were in a hurry, in a more easily composed rhymed prose; in which the ability to pen a creditable poem was considered as indispensable a part of an education as filling out a job application is in our own age. A poet who was more than merely creditable was a sought-after figure, often supported by wealthy patrons for whom he wrote verse to order.<br><br>In the Arabic-speaking Jewish society in which our young man lived, the language of these poems was always Hebrew. Yet the central role accorded to poetry did not stem originally from a Jewish impulse. Its history went back to the preliterate life of the Arabian desert, whose Bedouin tribes had poured out of it following the founding of Islam in the early seventh century and rapidly overrun much of the world under the new religion&#x2019;s martial banner. Among these desert nomads, the ability to extemporize verse had always been valued greatly. Poems were an everyday vehicle for the expression of emotion; for the sending of messages and requests; for the carrying of news from one encampment to another; for the recording and remembering of unusual events; for the wooing of the opposite sex; for the enhancement of celebrations; for the flattering of authority; for the vaunting of one&#x2019;s exploits; for the praising of one&#x2019;s friends and the derogation of one&#x2019;s enemies, and the like. The popular poetry tournaments held at the commercial fairs of pre-Islamic times testified to the regard in which gifted poetic improvisers were held&#x2014;and when, at moments of high drama or strong feeling, characters in medieval Arabic prose narratives like <i>One Thousand and One Nights</i> break into poetic speech, they are harking back to the traditions of the desert.<br><br>The cosmopolitan culture of the great Islamic cities of the East, such as Baghdad, Damascus, and Cairo, with their class of professional poets supported by the patronage of royalty and wealth, was far removed from Bedouin life. Yet the special place of poetry persisted in Arab society and spread from the East to Andalusia. The annals of Muslim Spain are replete with stories that illustrate how readily men and women were moved to, and swayed by, poetic diction. The eleventh-century poet-king of Seville, Ala&#x2019;llahi AlMu&#x2019;tamid, we are told, owed his marriage to this propensity. Once, as a young prince, he was sailing on the Guadalquivir River with a friend when, struck by the ripples on it, he spontaneously exclaimed, <i>Sana&#x2019;a &#x2018;r-rihu min el-mai zarad</i>, &#x201c;The wind has spun a coat-of-mail from the water,&#x201d; and challenged his companion to add a second line. Some slave girls were doing their laundry on the riverbank, and while the friend racked his brain, one of them, a stunning beauty who had overheard the prince&#x2019;s challenge, called back across the water, <i>Eyyu dir&#x2019;in li-qitalin low qamad</i>, &#x201c;What armor for battle if it stiffened!&#x201d; Al-Mu&#x2019;tamid was so taken by her cleverness and looks that he bought her from her master and married her. She was to be the love of his life.<br><br>Jewish Andalusia was not an exact replica of its Muslim surroundings. But while Jews in the Muslim world lived, on the whole, within a social framework of their own, they were more heavily influenced by their host culture than any previous rabbinically regulated Jewish society in the Diaspora. This was why Hebrew poetry, which was modeled on its Arabic counterpart in form and content, was so important to them, and why our young man had left home in his teens to seek his literary fortune in Spain&#x2019;s south, where the art of poetry was more advanced.</p><h2>Geschichte des Plakates</h2><p>Until today the poster has lost nothing either of its actuality or its effective power.

She is best known for the novel Little Women and its sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys. Little Women was set in the Alcott family home, Orchard House in Concord, Massachusetts, and published in 1868. This novel is loosely based on her childhood experiences with her three sisters. Alcott's literary success arrived with the publication by the Roberts Brothers of the first part of Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, a semi-autobiographical account of her childhood with her sisters in Concord, Massachusetts. Part two, or Part Second, also known as Good Wives, followed the March sisters into adulthood and their respective marriages. Little Men detailed Jo's life at the Plumfield School that she founded with her husband Professor Bhaer at the conclusion of Part Two of Little Women. Jo's Boys completed the "March Family Saga". In Little Women, Alcott based her heroine "Jo" on herself. But whereas Jo marries at the end of the story, Alcott remained single throughout her life. In her later life, Alcott became an advocate for women's suffrage and was the first woman to register to vote in Concord, Massachusetts, in a school board election. Alcott, along with Elizabeth Stoddard, Rebecca Harding Davis, Anne Moncure Crane, and others, were part of a group of female authors during the Gilded Age who addressed women&#x2019;s issues in a modern and candid manner. Alcott, who continued to write until her death, suffered chronic health problems in her later years. Alcott died of a stroke in Boston, on March 6, 1888, at age 55, two days after visiting her father's deathbed. Her last words were "Is it not meningitis?"</p><h2>Three Trapped Tigers (Latin American Literature)</h2><p><p>Cabrera Infante's masterpiece, Three Trapped Tigers is one of the most playful books to reach the U.S. from Cuba.

As usual, Gloria was eating. Dougless shifted her slim legs to try to make herself more comfortable around Gloria's luggage. There were six large pieces of matched leather luggage to hold Gloria's belongings, and since they wouldn't fit in the trunk of the little car, they were piled in the back with Dougless. There was a makeup case under her feet and a big wardrobe on the seat beside her. Every time she moved, she scraped against a buckle, a welt, or a handle. Right now, she had an itch under her left knee, but she couldn't reach it. </p><p> "Daddy," Gloria whined, sounding like an invalid four-year-old, "she's scratching the pretty suitcases you bought me." </p><p> Dougless clenched her fists, closed her eyes, and counted to ten. <i>She.</i> Gloria never said Dougless's name, but just called her <i>She.</i> </p><p> Robert glanced over his shoulder at Dougless. "Dougless, could you please be a bit more careful? That luggage is quite expensive." </p><p> "I am aware of that," Dougless said, trying to keep the anger out of her voice. "It's just that I'm having a difficult time sitting back here. There isn't much room." </p><p> Robert gave a great sigh of weariness. "Dougless, do you have to complain about everything? Can't you even allow a vacation to be pleasant? All I asked was that you make an effort." </p><p> Dougless opened her mouth to reply but closed it. She didn't want to start another argument. Besides, she knew that it would do no good. So, instead of replying, she swallowed her anger -- then rubbed her stomach. It was hurting again. She wanted to ask Robert to stop to get something to drink so she could take one of the tranquilizers the doctor had prescribed for her nervous stomach. "Keep this up and you'll give yourself an ulcer," the doctor had warned her. But Dougless wouldn't give Gloria the satisfaction of knowing that she'd yet again managed to upset Dougless and to, yet again, drive a wedge between Dougless and Robert. </p><p> But when Dougless glanced up, she saw Gloria smirking at her in the makeup mirror on the sun visor. With determination, Dougless looked away and tried to concentrate on the beauty of the English countryside. </p><p> Outside the car window she saw green fields, old stone fences, cows and more cows, picturesque little houses, magnificent mansions, and...and Gloria, she thought. Dougless seemed to see Gloria everywhere. Robert kept saying, "She's just a child and her daddy has left her. It's only natural that she's going to have some hostility toward you. But please try to show some sympathy for her, will you? She's really a sweet kid when you get to know her." </p><p> A sweet kid, Dougless thought as she looked out the window. At thirteen, Gloria wore more makeup than Dougless did at twenty-six -- and Gloria spent hours in the hotel bathroom applying it. Gloria sat in the front of the car. "She's just a kid and it's her first trip to England," Robert said. "And you've been to England before, so why not be generous?" That Dougless was supposed to read the road map when she could hardly see around Gloria's head didn't seem to count for much. </p><p> Dougless tried to concentrate on the scenery. Robert said Dougless was jealous of his daughter. He said that she didn't want to share him with anyone else, but that if she'd just relax, they'd be a very happy threesome. "We could be a second family for a little girl who has lost so much," he said. </p><p> Dougless had tried to like Gloria. She'd tried hard to be an adult and ignore, and even understand, Gloria's hostility, but it was more than Dougless could do. In the year she and Robert had been living together, Dougless had made every possible effort to find that "sweet kid" that Robert had told her of. Several times, she'd taken Gloria shopping and spent more money on Gloria than Dougless's small elementary school teacher's salary allowed her to spend on herself. Several Saturday nights Dougless had stayed at the house she shared with Robert, babysitting Gloria while he went to professional functions, usually cocktail parties or dinners. When Dougless had said she'd like to attend with him, Robert had said, "But time alone is what you two need. You need to get to know each other. And, remember, babe, I'm a package deal. Love me, love my kid." </p><p> Sometimes Dougless had started to believe that it was beginning to work because she and Gloria were cordial, even friendly, to each other when they were alone. But the minute Robert appeared, Gloria changed into a whining, lying brat. She sat on Robert's lap, all five foot two inches, one hundred and forty pounds of her, and wailed that <i>She</i> had been "awfully mean" to her. </p><p> At first Dougless had laughed at what Gloria was saying. How absurd to think she would ever harm a child! Anyone could see that the girl was just trying to get her father's attention. </p><p> But to Dougless's utter disbelief, Robert believed every word his daughter said. He didn't accuse Dougless. No, instead, he just asked her to be a "little kinder" to "the poor kid." Immediately, Dougless's defenses had gone up. "Is that supposed to mean you don't think I'm a kind person? You <i>do</i> think I would mistreat a child?" </p><p> "I'm just asking you to be the adult and have a little patience and understanding, that's all." </p><p> When Dougless asked what he meant by that, Robert had thrown up his hands and said that he couldn't talk to her; then he'd walked out of the room. Dougless had taken two of her stomach tranquilizers. </p><p> After the arguments, Dougless had wavered between guilt and rage. She had a classroom of children who adored her, yet Gloria seemed to hate her. <i>Was</i> Dougless jealous? Was she somehow unconsciously letting this child know she didn't want to share Robert with his own daughter? Every time Dougless thought of her possible jealousy she vowed to try harder to make Gloria like her, which usually meant she bought Gloria another expensive gift. And she'd again agree to babysit on the weekends when Gloria stayed with them. While Gloria's mother had a <i>life,</i> Dougless thought with bitterness. </p><p> At other times, all Dougless felt was rage. Couldn't Robert just once -- <i>one</i> time -- take Dougless's side? Couldn't he tell Gloria that Dougless's comfort was more important than the blasted suitcases? Or maybe he could tell Gloria that Dougless had a name and wasn't always to be referred to as <i>she</i> or <i>her?</i> But every time Dougless said something like that to Robert, she ended up apologizing. Robert said, "My God, Dougless, you're the adult. And I only see her on alternate weekends, so of course I'm going to favor her over you. You and I are together every day, so why can't you stand to play second fiddle now and then?" </p><p> His words sounded right, but at the same time, Dougless fantasized about Robert telling his daughter to "be more respectful" toward the "woman I love." </p><p> But that didn't happen, so Dougless kept her mouth shut and enjoyed the time she and Robert had when Gloria wasn't around. When Gloria wasn't with them, she and Robert were perfectly suited, and she knew, through age old intuition, that very soon she was going to receive what she wanted so much: a marriage proposal. </p><p> Truthfully, marriage was what Dougless wanted most in life. She'd never been burning with ambition the way her older sisters were. Dougless just wanted a nice home and a husband, and a few children. Maybe someday, after the kids were in school, she'd write children's books, something about talking animals, but she had no desire to fight her way up a corporate ladder. </p><p> Already, she'd invested eighteen months of her life in Robert, and he was perfect husband material. He was tall, handsome, well-dressed, and an excellent orthopedic surgeon. He always hung up his clothes, and he helped with the housework; he didn't chase after women, and he always came home when he said he would. He was reliable, dependable, faithful -- but, most important, he needed her so very much. </p><p> Not long after they met, Robert had told Dougless his life story. As a child, he hadn't been loved very much, and he told Dougless that her sweet, generous heart was what he'd been looking for all his life. His first wife, whom he'd divorced over four years ago, was a cold fish, a woman who Robert said was incapable of love. Just three months after he met Dougless, he told her he wanted a "permanent relationship" with her -- which she took to mean marriage -- but first he wanted to know how they "related" to each other. After all, he'd been hurt so badly the first time. In other words, he wanted them to live together. </p><p> What he said made sense to her, and since Dougless had had a number of "unfortunate" previous relationships with men, she happily moved into Robert's big, beautiful, expensive house, then set about doing everything she could to prove to Robert that she was as warm and generous and loving as his mother and wife had been cold. </p><p> With the exception of dealing with Gloria, living with Robert had been great. He was an energetic man and they often went dancing, hiking, bicycle riding. They entertained a great deal and often went to parties. She'd never lived with a man before, but she had easily settled into a domestic routine, feeling as though it was what she was made for. </p><p> They had problems other than Gloria, of course, but Robert was so much better than any of the other men Dougless had dated that she forgave him his little quirks -- most of which revolved around money. True, it was annoying that when they went to the grocery together he nearly always "forgot" his checkbook. And at the ticket window of theaters and when the check was presented in restaurants, half the time Robert found he'd left his wallet at home. If Dougless complained, he'd talk to her about the new age of liberated women and how most women were fighting to pay half the expenses. Then he'd kiss her sweetly and take her somewhere expensive for dinner -- and he'd pay. And Dougless forgave him. </p><p> Dougless knew she could stand the small problems -- everyone had idiosyncracies -- but it was Gloria that sent her screaming. When Gloria was with them, their life turned into a battleground. According to Robert, his daughter was perfection on earth, and because Dougless didn't see her that way, Robert began to see Dougless as the enemy. When the three of them were together, it was Robert and Gloria on one team and Dougless on the other. </p><p> Now, on this holiday in England, in the front seat Gloria offered her father a piece of candy from the box on her lap. Neither of them seemed to think of offering any to Dougless. </p><p> Still looking out the window, Dougless gritted her teeth. Perhaps it was the combination of Gloria and money that was making her so angry, because, with this trip, Robert's little "money quirk" as Dougless had always thought of it, had turned into something more. </p><p> When Dougless had first met Robert, they had talked for hours about their dreams and they'd talked many times of taking a trip to England. As a child, she had often traveled to England with her family, but she hadn't been back in years. When she and Robert had moved in together, in September of last year, Robert had said, "Let's go to England one year from today. By then we'll know." He hadn't elaborated on what they would "know," but Dougless was sure that he meant that, in a year, they'd know whether or not they were compatible for marriage. </p><p> For a whole year, Dougless had worked on planning the trip, which she'd come to think of as their honeymoon. A "pre-honeymoon," she called it in her mind. "The decision maker," she said to herself, then smiled. She made reservations at the most romantic, most exclusive country house hotels England had to offer. When she had asked Robert's opinion of a hotel, he'd winked at her and said, "Spare no expense for this trip." She had ordered brochures, bought travel books, read and researched until she knew the names of half the villages in England. Robert's only stipulation had been that he wanted an educational trip as well as fun, so she'd compiled a list of many things to do that were close to their lovely hotels -- which was easy to do, since Great Britain is like a Disneyland for history lovers. </p><p> Then, three months before they were to leave, Robert said that he had a surprise for her on this trip, a very, very special surprise that was going to fill her with joy. His words had made Dougless work even harder on the plans, and she found their little game of secrecy exciting. As Dougless planned, she thought, Will he propose here? Or maybe here. This place would be nice. </p><p> Three weeks before they left, she was balancing Robert's household-accounts checkbook when she saw a canceled check for five thousand dollars made out to a jewelry store. </p><p> As she held the check, tears of happiness came to her eyes. "An engagement ring," she'd whispered. That Robert had spent so much was proof that even though he was a tad stingy on small things, when something really counted, he was generous. </p><p> For the next few weeks Dougless had walked on clouds. She cooked wonderful meals for Robert and had been especially energetic in the bedroom, doing everything she could think of to please him. </p><p> Two days before they were to leave, Robert punctured her bubble a bit -- not enough to burst it, but it had certainly been deflated. He had asked to see the bills for the trip, plane tickets, advance reservations, whatever she had. He had then added the amounts and handed her the calculator tape. </p><p> "This is your half of the cost," he'd said. </p><p> "Mine?" she'd asked stupidly, not understanding what he was saying. </p><p> "I know how important it is to you women today to pay your own way, so I don't want to be accused of being a male chauvinist pig," he'd said with a smile. "You don't want to be a burden to a man, do you? You don't want to add to all my responsibilities at the hospital and to my ex-wife, do you?" </p><p> "No, no, of course not," Dougless had mumbled, feeling confused, as she often did when confronted with Robert's reasoning. "It's just that I don't have any money." </p><p> "Dougless, baby, please tell me that you don't spend everything you make. Maybe you should take a course in accounting." He lowered his voice. "But then your family has money, doesn't it?" </p><p> That was one of the times Dougless's stomach had begun to hurt, and she remembered the doctor's warning about giving herself an ulcer. She had explained to Robert about her family a hundred times. Yes, her family had money -- lots of it -- but her father believed his daughters should know how to support themselves, so Dougless was on her own until she was thirty-five; then she'd inherit. She knew that if there was an emergency, her father would help her, but a pleasure trip to England hardly counted as an emergency. </p><p> "Come on, Dougless," Robert had said with a smile when Dougless didn't reply to his question. "I keep hearing what a paragon of love and support that family of yours is, so why can't they help you now?" Before she could speak, Robert raised her hand to hi...</p></p><h2>Nigella Express</h2><p>The Domestic Goddess is back, and this time it's instant.

Joseph seems to be the one who will be chosen to carry on the family name and birthright, but Jacob makes a startling announcement: &#34;The scepter will not depart from Judah until Shiloh comes...&#34; Lions of Judah, Book 4.</p><p>Gilbert Morris was a pastor before becoming an English professor and earning a Ph.D. at the University of Arkansas. Gilbert has been a consistent bestselling author (The House of Winslow) in the Christian market for many years. He and his wife live in Gulf Shores, Alabama."Mr. Morris brings the Bible to life... and proves once again why he is a best-selling master storyteller." -- <i>Romantic Times</i></p><h2>God Laughs &amp; Plays; Churchless Sermons in Response to the Preachments of the Fundamentalist Right</h2><p>The most important book on religion this year, perhaps this decade. --<i> The Literary Spirituality Review</i> <p>In this multiple award-winning and bestselling diagnosis of the contemporary American spirit, David James Duncan suggests that the de facto political party embodied by the so-called Christian Right has turned worship into a self-righteous betrayal of the words and example of the very Jesus it claims to praise. In a bracing and often hilarious response to this trend, God Laughs &amp; Plays offers churchless sermons, stories, memoir, conversations, and cosmological reflections that scorn riches and embrace the poor; bless peacemakers, not war-makers; celebrate creation, diversity, empathy, playfulness and beauty; and insist that Divine Mystery is indeed mysterious and compassion is literally compassionate. The spiritual kingdom described by Jesus, this unusual book reminds us, is located not "in the Sky" or beyond a disastrous future, but within us, to be sought and embodied in the here and now.</p></p><p>"Hilarious, enraged, articulate, eloquent, and passionate in ways that will make you gape. Duncan is one of the finest writers of spiritually minded essays in these United States, period. Trust me, this is a book that matters." - Brian Doyle, <i>Christian Century Magazine</i>, Feb. 2007"I WAS BORN A CHOSEN PERSON, though this state of affairs was not of my choosing."<p><b>Award-winning essayist and novelist David James Duncan focuses on the conflation of neoconservative politics and apocalyptic evangelical fundamentalism.</b></p><p>In <i>God Laughs and Plays</i>, Duncan argues that the de facto political party embodied by the so-called Christian Right has turned worship into a self-righteous betrayal of the words and example of the very Jesus it claims to praise. In reply, Duncan offers a thought-provoking collection of "churchless sermons," stories, memoir, and conversations - all united by the contention that the way of life preached and embodied by Jesus is apolitical and should be free of media machinery.</p><p>While reminding us that the true Christian ethos scorns riches and embraces the poor; blesses peacemakers, not war maker; and asks us to love and serve neighbors and "do good" even unto enemies, Duncan also goes a step further: he offers a poignant, playful, yet inspiring glimpse into a profound new cosmology that can help humanity manage the epochal challenges of a fast-globalizing and ecologically compromised world.</p></p><h2>Augie&#39;s Secrets: The Minneapolis Mob and the King of the Hennepin Strip</h2><p>&nbsp;There's an old Yiddish saying: two people can keep a secret if one of them is dead. But two living people could keep a secret--as long as one of them was Augie.<br><br>Augie Ratner, the proprietor of Augie's Theater Lounge &amp; Bar on Hennepin Avenue, was the unofficial mayor of Minneapolis's downtown strip in the 1940s and '50s. In a few blocks between the swanky clubs and restaurants on Eighth Street and the sleazy flophouses and bars of the Gateway District, the city's shakers-and-movers and shake-down artists mingled. Gangsters and celebrities, comedians and politicians, the rich and the famous and the infamous--all of them met at Augie's: Jimmy Hoffa, Henny Youngman, Kid Cann, John Dillinger, Jack Dempsey, Peggy Lee, Groucho Marx, Lenny Bruce, and Gypsy Rose Lee. Augie Ratner knew everyone, and everyone knew and liked Augie, and they told him everything.<br><br>Mixing careful research with long suppressed family and community stories, Neal Karlen, Augie's great-nephew, tells the real story of the seamy underside of Minneapolis, where Jewish mobsters controlled the liquor trade, invented the point spread in sports betting, and ran national sports gambling operations. Even after Mayor Hubert H. Humphrey supposedly cleaned up the town, organized crime quietly flourished.

That is, of course, not true. History is written by historians, but without access to archives, without the existence of archives, there would be no history. Jimerson, a professional archivist and past president of the Society of American Archivists, explains what archives are and why it is essential that they be maintained. He works primarily with American records but his observations are universally applicable. In his preface, Jimerson states his belief in social responsibility and justice. The preservation of primary documents is part of the process of discovering the truth. When information is destroyed, so is accurate history. What people and governments choose to save says much about them. He demonstrates this with the South African records made during Apartheid, and how they are now being used to redress injustices. Jimerson also discusses the role of the archivist in organizing and interpreting data. His obvious passion for his profession and its importance is conveyed on every page. Archives do have power, from recording major events to proving where and when one was born. This book is a reminder of how essential they are to a free society.

She hovered in the door, a blond angel on a miserable winter night, not welcoming him inside and not refusing him entry-a succinct metaphor for Elijah's dealings with Polite Society.</p> <p>"I must beg your hospitality, my lady, for my horse has gone lame, and the weather is worsening. Elijah Harrison, at your service. I left the last posting inn some miles back and have seen no other hostelries along the way."</p> <p>He shivered in the wind and sleet and tried not to let his teeth chatter. He was ready for her to refuse him or tell him to go 'round back and seek entry of the cook. The very fingers by which he made his living-and a number of other parts-were long since numb, or he would not have knocked on even this door.</p> <p>The lady stepped back and gestured him inside. "Gracious heavens, Mr. Harrison, come in this instant. I hope the grooms are seeing to your horse?"</p> <p>Her green eyes were lit with concern, and not-bless her-for his horse.</p> <p>"My thanks." He passed into the warmth and quiet of the Earl of Kesmore's country house as she closed the door behind him. "When last I saw him, the beast was being led into a cozy stall, his limp improving apace at the prospect of straw bedding and a ration of oats."</p> <p>"I'm Jenny Windham," she said, and that she would eschew her title-as he had eschewed his-caught his curiosity. "The servants are quite done in, today being Stirring-Up Sunday. Let me take your coat."</p> <p>She hefted the sodden wool from his shoulders and hung it on a hook, spreading the capes and sleeves just so, the better for the garment to dry. This attention to Elijah's outerwear gave him a moment to study her the way a portrait artist was doomed to study all others of his own species.</p> <p>Her hands had a competence about them he would not have expected from a duke's daughter. She dealt with wet fabric as any yeoman's wife might, then held out a hand for Elijah's scarf.</p> <p>"I've never seen it rain ice," she said. "An occasional sleety afternoon, yes, but not this... this"-she grimaced at his scarf-"unending mess. Nobody will be going anywhere if they have any sense. I hope you hadn't far to go?"</p> <p>Again the concern in her eyes, and for an uninvited guest who had no business inconveniencing her.</p> <p>Elijah focused on peeling off damp wool and sopping gloves. "A few more miles yet, but I'm not familiar with the neighborhood, and nothing good ever comes of forcing a lame horse to soldier on."</p> <p>"Nothing good at all. You must accept our hospitality tonight, Mr. Harrison. You'll come with me to the library."</p> <p>She did not explain to him that the earl and his countess would be down shortly to welcome him properly, though Elijah well knew this was Joseph Carrington's house. He would not have presumed to knock otherwise.</p> <p>And yet he followed Lady Genevieve down a dimly lit corridor without protest, watching the way her carrying candle and the mirrored sconces moved light and shadow across her feminine form. By the time they reached the library, Elijah's feet were starting the diabolical itching that accompanied a thawing of limbs too long exposed to winter's wrath.</p> <p>"You can warm up in here, and we'll have a room prepared for you," Lady Genevieve said as she set her candle on a delicately scrolled chestnut sideboard. When his gaze fell upon an embroidery hoop left on the sofa, Elijah realized the lady herself had occupied the library earlier.</p> <p>"You're burning wood." The sweet tang of wood smoke blended with other scents-beeswax, cinnamon, and something floral, an altogether lovely olfactory bouquet.</p> <p>"Lord Kesmore prefers to burn wood, and his home wood is extensive. If you'll give up those boots, Mr. Harrison, I'll have somebody take them down to the kitchen for a polishing. Leave it any later, and the boot boy will have gone to bed."</p> <p>Stirring-Up Sunday saw the plum pudding tucked into its brandy bath. The kitchen had no doubt been a merry place for much of the day, and the help would need to sleep off the results of their exertions.</p> <p>How he loathed Christmas in its every detail.</p> <p>"I'll wrestle my boots off, but please don't put anybody to any trouble. I would not want to impose on his lordship's staff unnecessarily."</p> <p>He did not elaborate, leaving her another opportunity to explain that his lordship wouldn't find it any imposition, and would be told immediately of his visitor.</p> <p>"I'll see to some sustenance for you, Mr. Harrison. Please make yourself comfortable."</p> <p>She bobbed a curtsy; he bowed. The moment she left the room, Elijah picked up the embroidery hoop to study the gossamer-fine chemise it held. The itching was climbing from his feet to his calves, and would soon overtake his thighs, but he'd seen such needlework only on his mother's very own hoop, and the artist in him had long grown used to ignoring all manner of bodily inconveniences and urges.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Jenny returned from the kitchen to find her guest standing before the fire in his stocking feet and shirtsleeves, her embroidery hoop in his hands.</p> <p>Which would not do. It would not do at all.</p> <p>"Come eat, Mr. Harrison. I gather the making of the plum pudding occasions something of a celebration among the staff, and so the larder boasted impressive offerings. They'll be decorating the house tomorrow in anticipation of the Yule season."</p> <p>His dark brows lowered and, more importantly, he set her embroidery hoop on the mantel. "I apologize for my state of undress, but my coat was damp."</p> <p>Said coat-more sopping than damp-was now draped over the back of a chair set close to the fire, steam rising from the fabric.</p> <p>Which accounted for the wet-wool scent accompanying the cozier fragrances wafting through the library. Jenny set the tray on the low table before the hearth just as the eight-day clock in the hallway chimed the hour.</p> <p>"Don't stand on ceremony, Mr. Harrison. You must be famished."</p> <p>And as for his state of undress... Jenny knew firsthand that for all his height, he was lean and hard, every muscle and sinew in evidence when he was naked. Every rib, every pale blue vein, every dark, curling hair on his chest... and elsewhere.</p> <p>"May I pour for you, sir?"</p> <p>"Please."</p> <p>She took a place on the sofa while he remained standing, which reminded her that whatever else was true about Mr. Elijah Harrison, he had the manners of a gentleman. "You must sit, or you will get crumbs all over the countess's carpet, and she will not be pleased."</p> <p>He came down on the sofa, making the cushions bounce and shift with his weight. "I gather mine host and his countess have already retired?"</p> <p>A maiden-aunt-in-training ought to expect such questions.</p> <p>"I would not know. They are from home, and I am keeping my nieces company in their absence. How do you take your tea?"</p> <p>He was given to silences, which Jenny should have expected from a man who painted for a living. Some artists were so mentally busy trafficking in images that words came to them only reluctantly-a sorry, second-rate form of communication.</p> <p>"Lady Genevieve, if I know we are without chaperonage, then I will mount my lame horse and find other accommodations. I account Kesmore among my few friends and would not want to give him offense."</p> <p>To go with his beautiful body and his beautiful hands, he had a beautiful, masculine voice. She could have listened to that voice recite Scripture and still pictured him without his clothes.</p> <p>"My aunt is abed on the next floor up." She paused midreach for the teapot. "You used my title."</p> <p>His mouth didn't shift, but something in his eyes suggested humor. "I make a habit out of attending many of the London social functions. Because I must work in all available daylight hours, I spend most of my evenings dozing in the card room. Even so, I have observed you often from a polite distance."</p> <p>Something about the way he used the word observed had Jenny fussing with the tea things. She was rattled by his disclosure, so rattled she fixed her own cup of tea first, with both sugar and cream.</p> <p>Did he know she'd observed him as well, for hours, when he'd worn nothing but indolence and an offhand sensuality?</p> <p>"You are prescient," he said, lifting the full cup. "You know how I like my tea."</p> <p>The humor had found its way to his voice, which made Jenny curious to see what a smile would look like on that full, solemn mouth. For all the parts of him she had seen, she had never seen him smile.</p> <p>"A lucky guess," she said. "Just as finding your way to Kesmore's doorstep tonight must have been good luck for you."</p> <p>"And for my horse." He saluted with his teacup, his fingers red with returning circulation.</p> <p>"Eat something." Jenny passed him an empty plate. "Chasing the chill from your room will take some time, and you have to be hungry."</p> <p>As he filled a plate with as much buttered bread, ham, and cheddar as any one of Jenny's brothers might have consumed at a sitting, Jenny indulged in closer study of her guest. His dark hair was damp, and around his eyes, fine lines gave him a world-weary air. He was not a boy, hadn't been a boy for years.</p> <p>She'd had particular occasion to admire his nose. The nose on Elijah Harrison's face announced that no compromises would be made easily by its owner, no goal casually cast aside for costing too much effort. Had she not seen the entire rest of him, she would have chosen that nose as his best feature.</p> <p>He paused between assembling his meal and consuming it. "You're not eating with me, Lady Genevieve?"</p> <p>He'd said her name with a little glide on the initial G-"Zhenevieve"-the way a Frenchman might have said it. He had studied in France. Somehow, despite the Corsican's protracted nonsense, Elijah Harrison had managed to study in France. She envied him this to a point approaching bitterness. "I'll nibble some cheese."</p> <p>"Like a starving mouse?"</p> <p>"Like a woman who had a decent meal not that long ago." Like a woman who knew it was time to have done with visually devouring her guest. "What brings you to our neighborhood, Mr. Harrison?"</p> <p>"Work, of course. Some sentimental old fellow has taken it into his head-or perhaps his lady wife has taken it into her head-to have portraits done of his youngest progeny. If I'm to present myself to the world as a well-rounded portraitist, then I must add children to the subjects in my portfolio."</p> <p>He said this as if painting children was an occupational hazard, like napping in card rooms.</p> <p>"Is it difficult to paint children?" Between one heartbeat and the next, Jenny realized Elijah Harrison knew a great deal that she wished she could learn from him. He'd travel on in the morning, but for as much as the next hour, she could interrogate him to her heart's content.</p> <p>He didn't answer immediately. Instead, he put bread, cheese, and some apple slices on a plate and held it out to her. His gaze held a challenge.</p> <p>Over a simple meal? Abruptly, Jenny wondered if he'd recognized her.</p> <p>She took the plate and tossed her list of questions aside.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Genevieve Windham was not pretty, she was exquisite.</p> <p>Pretty in present English parlance meant blond hair and blue eyes, regular features, and a willingness to spend significant sums at the modiste of the hour.</p> <p>Unless a woman was emaciated or obese, her figure mattered little, there being corsets, padding, and other devices available to augment the Creator's handiwork. Failing those artifices, one resorted to the good offices of the portraitist, who could at least render a lady's likeness pretty even if the lady herself were not.</p> <p>Lady Jenny left pretty sitting on its arse in the mud several leagues back. Her eyes were a luminous, emerald green, not blue. Her hair was gold, not blond. Her figure surpassed the willowy lines preferred by Polite Society and veered off into the realms of sirens, houris, and dreams a grown man didn't admit aloud lest he imperil his dignity.</p> <p>The itching over Elijah's body faded in the face of the itch he felt to sketch her.</p> <p>She had certainly sketched him, after all.</p> <p>"Have some sustenance, my lady. For me to eat alone would be rude, and I intend to consume a deal of food."</p> <p>Lady Jenny took the plate, and though he was ravenous, he wanted to watch her eat more than he wanted to fill his belly. "My thanks, sir."</p> <p>So... small talk. His livelihood depended as much on his ability to make small talk as it did on his talent for slapping paint onto canvas. "How fare my lord and lady Kesmore?"</p> <p>"When did you first know you wanted to paint portraits?"</p> <p>They'd spoken at the same time, though he'd put his question to her, and she'd directed hers to the plate of gingerbread on the tray. Elijah added a slice to her meal and waited.</p> <p>"Lord and Lady Kesmore are in good health and wonderful spirits. They look forward to the holidays, as do their children."</p> <p>Not an answer, but rather, a recitation.</p> <p>He offered reciprocal superficiality. "I was born with an interest in the arts."</p> <p>She glanced over at him, her expression suggesting he was a plate of holiday treats she must not be caught snitching from. "An interest in the arts? A general interest only?"</p> <p>His answer was the one he gave whenever members of the Royal Academy asked the question Lady Jenny had. The Academy boasted sculptors as well as painters, and one was elevated to membership by vote of the Royal Academicians. A general interest had struck him as the more politic reply.</p> <p>Lady Jenny was not considering him for membership in the Royal Academy, and would never be in a position to do so.</p> <p>"Painting has been my preoccupation for as long as I can remember," he said. "When the other lads were clamoring for a pony or playing Robinson Crusoe or longing to explore darkest Africa, all I wanted to do was paint."</p> <p>In some regards, he would have been better off in darkest Africa. Rather than ponder that unhappy truth, he popped a bite of gingerbread in his mouth.</p> <p>"And where did you study, Mr. Harrison?"</p> <p>This mattered to her, or mattered more than ham, cheese, gingerbread, apples, and hot tea. "Might I prevail upon you to pour again, my lady?" Because he'd downed his tea in one hot, indecorous gulp.</p> <p>"Of course."</p> <p>"I studied here and there. I have French cousins on my mother's side, and while Paris was no fit destination for an Englishman for quite some time, my cousins sought refuge in Italy, Denmark, and Switzerland. I made a royal progress of visiting them and their drawing masters. My mother spoke French to me from the cradle, so France was not as risky for me as it would have been for others."</p> <p>Her Exquisite Ladyship fixed his second cup of tea, while he forgot his meal and instead focused on how firelight reflected off the tea service and off her hair. Lady Jenny was not a woman of angles; she was a woman of curves-an elegant curve to her spine in particular suggesting she'd eschewed stays due to the lateness of the hour, or perhaps-being in the country-she had settled for...</p></p><h2>Revelation Pure and Simple</h2><p>This book on Revelation was not written for the theologian or Bible scholar. It was written for the man on the street - the man who&#39;s been told that Revelation is so full of symbolism that it cannot be understood. It was also written for those who have been told the events of Revelation have already passed and do not apply to us; that they will all take place in the future, long after we&#39;re gone; or that we will not be on earth when they take place - and a dozen other excuses for not understanding the truths that Jesus said we could and should. It was written for the person who has a desire to know what Christ told John concerning the days we live in and for the person who wants to see the unfolding of prophecy, as one event after another takes place - each prophecy expanding and enlarging the next. As you walk through Revelation, chapter by chapter in this easy reading format, your eyes will be opened to the roles played by different nations of the world. Expect a blessing as you read, listen, and keep the things written in this book. You can depend on it, for He promised it.</p><p></p><h2>The Stupids Die</h2><p>The Stupid family thinks they are dead when the lights go out.</p><p>Harry Allard is the author of many hilarious books for children, including several <i>Miss Nelson</i> and <i>Stupid Family</i> titles, all illustrated by James Marshall.<br> &nbsp;&#34;Excellent pacing, concise, witty prose, and artwork perfectly suited to the text.&#34; School Library Journal, Starred</p><h2>His Bright Light, The Story of Nick Traina Large Print</h2><p>Large Print edition, True story of the life and death of the son of Danielle Steel</p><p></p><h2>The Strength of the Wolf: The Secret History of America&#39;s War on Drugs</h2><p>The Strength of the Wolf presents for the first time a definitive history of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) from its birth in 1930 until its wrenching termination in 1968. Carefully and extensively documented, the book is based largely on interviews with former FBN agents, and in this respect The Strength of the Wolf represents a new chapter in American history, one that introduces a cast of fabulous characters.<br><br>Douglas Valentine tells how the FBN&#x2019;s premier case-making agents penetrated the arcane world of international drug trafficking and, by uncovering the Establishment&#x2019;s ties to organized crime, brought about their own demise. As the book reveals in startling detail, the CIA and FBI were often protecting the FBN&#x2019;s major targets in the Mafia and the French Corsican underworld. The CIA and its Nationalist Chinese allies were found to be the largest drug-trafficking syndicate in the world, but for political and national security reasons, the FBN was prevented from investigating this overarching conspiracy.</p><p><b>Douglas Valentine</b> has lectured and appeared on TV and radio talk shows, testified as an expert witness, served as a documentary film consultant and worked as a private investigator. His previous books include <i>The Hotel Tacloban, The Phoenix Program</i> and<i> TDY</i>.Before the Drug Enforcement Administration was created in 1973, before the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs was founded in 1968, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) served as the country&#x2019;s primary drug law enforcement agency. In this thoroughly researched history, Valentine (The Phoenix Program; The Hotel Tacloban, etc.) offers an in-depth look at the FBN&#x2019;s obscure organization and its various activities, which lasted from 1930 until the end of the &#x2018;60s. Valentine writes extensively about Harry J. Anslinger, the commissioner whose "personality, policies and appointments" defined the agency and the government&#x2019;s war on drugs for more than 30 years. He describes how FBN officers were trained to "make arrests, gather evidence for presentation in court, test and handle seized narcotics, tail suspects without being seen, and rule their informants with an iron fist." Drawing upon interviews with former agents and federal officers (such as Howard Chappell, George Gaffney and Col. Tully Acampora), Valentine also provides firsthand accounts of bureau operations both at home and abroad, and of business relationships fostered among FBN ranks. Despite the volume&#x2019;s ambitious premise and Valentine&#x2019;s hard work, however, this lengthy history will probably fail to engross most casual readers since its material proves dense and, occasionally, difficult. But for political historians and those already interested in the history of the war on drugs, Valentine&#x2019;s unearthing of rare primary sources should prove invaluable. 16 pages of b&amp;w photos<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Randi and his team of researchers attended scores of "miracle services" and often were pronounced "healed" of the nonexistent illnesses they claimed. They viewed first-hand the tragedies resulting from the wide-spread belief that faith healing can cure every conceivable disease. The ministries, they discovered, were rife with deception, chicanery, and often outright fraud.<br><br>Self-annointed ministers of God convince the gullible that they have been healed - and that they should pay for the service. The Faith Healers examines in depth the reasons for belief in faith healing and the catastrophic results for the victims of these hoaxes. Included in Randi's book are profiles of a highly profitable "psychic dentist", and the "Vatican-approved wizard."</p><p><b>James Randi</b>&nbsp; is a Canadian-American stage magician and scientific skeptic best known as a challenger of paranormal claims and pseudoscience. Randi is the founder of the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF). He began his career as a magician, as The Amazing Randi, but after retiring at age 60, he began investigating paranormal, occult, and supernatural claims. Although often referred to as a "debunker," Randi rejects that title owing to its perceived bias, instead describing himself as an "investigator." He has written about the paranormal, skepticism, and the history of magic, and has published many books including<i> Flim-Flam!</i>, <i>The Truth about Uri Geller</i>, <i>The Faith Healers</i>, and <i>The Mask of Nostradamus</i>. He was a frequent guest on <i>The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson</i> and was occasionally featured on the television program <i>Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!</i>.YA Are there people chosen by God to heal bodily ailments through the power of prayer alone? Randi's answer is ``maybe,'' but on the basis of his three-year investigation into faith heal ers, he hasn't found any evidence of it and suggests it may be nothing more than a religious con game. The author, a professional magician, has made it a sideline to expose fraud and miscon ceptions in the realm of the paranormal. Leading evangelists such as Oral Rob erts, Peter Popoff, W. V. Grant, Pat Robertson, and others are all shown to use tactics that are at best misleading, to guide the faithful into believing that they have been supernaturally cured by prayer alone. At worst, some of these men are shown to be cynical frauds preying on the desperation of the seri ously ill. The book is not tightly writ ten, but it can be read for enlighten ment.

Dominick McMahon, a merchant by trade, has little appetite for fighting, yet is forced to defend his town against Cromwell&#39;s army. From dark city streets to wild mountains, from vicious slaughter to triumphant faith, from selfish obedience to heroic opposition this novel paints a vivid portrait of the struggles of the Irish people against the English.

He shows the critical elements of any parent-infant clinical system: the parents&#39; representations of the relationship with the baby, their overt interactions, the infant&#39;s representations of these interactions, and the role of the therapist.</p><p>With the publication in 1985 of The Interpersonal World of the Infant, Daniel N. Stern changed the way we understand how individuals develop a sense of self. Now in this pioneering new work of creative synthesis, he maps out the emerging field of parent-infant psychotherapy and describes a powerful new paradigm for understanding the relationship between parent and child: the motherhood constellation. With the birth of a baby, Stern argues, the mother (and, to some extent, the father) passes into a unique stage of life with a new set of tendencies, sensibilities, fantasies, fears, and wishes. This new organization of mental life - the motherhood constellation - forces clinicians working with mothers and infants to adopt a different treatment framework and therapeutic alliance. From an analysis of the leading schools of parent-infant psychotherapy, Stern crystallizes the factors that effect change. He shows in vivid detail the critical elements of any parent-infant clinical system: the parents&#39; representations of the relationship with their baby, the overt interactions occurring between parent and infant, the infant&#39;s representations of these interactions, and the place of the therapist in this clinical system. Through his clear picture of the clinical situation, refined search for what&#39;s effective in parent-infant therapy, and illustration of the motherhood constellation, Stern reveals a general new form of therapy. This wholly original view of parent-infant psychotherapy and motherhood, with its practical implications for therapy, is a major contribution to our understanding of human development, psychopathology, and therapy in general.<b>Daniel N.

This is mine.</i><br><br>One summer in the sixties, in a staid suburb south of London, nineteen-year-old Paul comes home from university and is urged by his mother to join the tennis club. There he&#x2019;s partnered with Susan Macleod, a fine player who&#x2019;s forty-eight, confident, witty, and married, with two nearly adult daughters. She is a warm companion, her bond with Paul immediate. And soon, inevitably, they are lovers. <br><br> Basking in the glow of one another, they set up house together in London. Decades later, Paul looks back at how they fell in love and how&#x2014;gradually, relentlessly&#x2014;everything fell apart. As he turns over his only story in his mind, examining it from different vantage points, he finds himself confronted with the contradictions and slips of his own memory&#x2014;and the ways in which our narratives and our lives shape one another. Poignant, vivid and profound, <i>The Only Story</i> is a searing novel of memory, devotion, and how first love fixes a life forever.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of April 2018:</strong> In Julian Barnes&#x2019;s ruminative, finely wrought, and often wryly funny novel, <em>The Only Story</em> is the story of love: the ideal of love, and love as it is lived. In this case, it&#x2019;s the story of Paul and Susan, who are, respectively, 19 and 49 when they meet. As in his Man Booker prize-winning novel, <em>The Sense of an Ending</em>, Barnes is preoccupied by memory&#x2019;s lapses and the subjectivity of truth. This is also a novel about drinking, and Barnes serves up a quintessentially late-career cocktail. Leave sweet drinks to the young, he seems to say. The mature palate calls for bitters. <p>&#x201c;Most of us have only one story to tell,&#x201d; says Paul. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean that only one thing happens to us in our lives: there are countless events, which we turn into countless stories. But there&#x2019;s only one that matters, only one finally worth telling. This is mine.&#x201d; It begins more than fifty years ago, in the kind of London suburb where stockbrokers play cricket on the Village Green on Saturdays. When a new delicatessen opens, residents view it as &#x201c;subversive in its offerings of European goods.&#x201d;</p> <p>Paul meets Susan at the local tennis club, and at first their 30-year age difference doesn&#x2019;t seem to matter. &#x201c;In terms of &#x2013; what shall I call it? The age of her spirit, perhaps &#x2013; we aren&#x2019;t that far apart.&#x201d; As time darkens the lovers&#x2019; initial exuberance, Paul&#x2019;s narration, which began with the immediacy of the first person voice, shifts, heartbreakingly, to the second, and ultimately, when he feels &#x201c;rebuked by life,&#x201d; to the third. Though readers will marvel at the sophistication of this and other novelistic strategies Barnes employs, their end result is that though we might wish <em>The Only Story</em> had a sweeter ending, the one Barnes gives us feels deeply true: bitter, yes, but satisfying, too. <em>&#x2014;Sarah Harrison Smith, Amazon Book Review</em></p>JULIAN BARNES is the author of twenty-one previous books, for which he has received the Man Booker Prize, the Somerset Maugham Award, the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize, the David Cohen Prize for Literature, and the E.

Kadushin's silvery, feminine voice delivers the unfolding events with precise, consistent timing, showcasing Meyer's story without overwhelming it.

Simpson dedicates the book to his climbing partner, Simon Yates, and to "those friends who have gone to the mountains and have not returned." What is it that compels certain individuals to willingly seek out the most inhospitable climate on earth? To risk their lives in an attempt to leave footprints where few or none have gone before? Simpson's vivid narrative of a dangerous climbing expedition will convince even the most die-hard couch potato that such pursuits fall within the realm of the sane. As the author struggles ever higher, readers learn of the mountain's awesome power, the beautiful--and sometimes deadly--sheets of blue glacial ice, and the accomplishment of a successful ascent. And then catastrophe: the second half of <i>Touching the Void</i> sees Simpson at his darkest moment. With a smashed, useless leg, he and his partner must struggle down a near-vertical face--and that's only the beginning of their troubles.5 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Stokes Field Guide to Birds: Eastern Region (Stokes Field Guides)</h2><p>The easiest-to-use and most comprehensive field guide to North American birds-from the country&#39;s preeminent writers on birds and nature Drawing on more than twenty years&#39; experience as bird and wildlife experts, Donald and Lillian Stokes have produced field guides that are factually, visually, and organizationally superior to any other books you can buy. You&#39;ll find: * All the identification information on a single page-color photographs, range map, and detailed description. No more fumbling to match photos with text! * For fast reference-a compact alphabetical index inside the front and back covers. * More than 900 high-resolution color identification photographs. * An illustrated Quick Guide to the most common backyard and feeder birds. * Convenient colored tabs keyed to each bird group. * Concise and comprehensive text, with information on habitat; plumage variation; feeding, nesting, and mating behavior; bird feeder proclivity; and-for the first time in any guide-population trends and conservation status.</p><p>Together these new field guides cover the continental United States (except western Alaska) and Canada; the 100th meridian is the dividing line between regions. In each volume, the taxonomically arranged species accounts (mostly one per page; occasionally two similar species are combined) include common and scientific names; one to three color photos; terse comments on identifying features, feeding, nesting, other behavior, habitat, voice, and population trends; and a range map. Special "learning pages" precede some difficult groups like gulls and sparrows. Most species of regular occurrence in the region are included; a few extremely local rarities are omitted. The text is clearly written, accurate, and up-to-date; the 1995 AOU (American Ornithologists' Union) Checklist changes are included. With so many other North American bird guides from the Audubon Society, Roger Tory Peterson, and others currently in print, any new guide should meet some special need. These works are particularly suited to novice birders. Putting all the data about a species on a single page facilitates use (e.g., it isn't possible to depict every varying plumage of all species), and the intentional omission of rarities that barely reach the region is valid. The inclusion of population data is unique and valuable. These titles supplement but do not supplant existing guides; the appropriate regional volume is recommended for public and academic libraries.<br><i>Paul B.

First, a corpus is discovered: the unpublished works of Cornell Woolrich, a popular writer of the 1940s, remembered for such classics as The Bride Wore Black and The Night Has a Thousand Eyes. In its midst is the torso of Into the Night, minus a beginning, end and a few other parts. Lawrence Block, author of the Matt Scudder and Evan Tanner series, is invited to fill in the blanks. The final product is a sort of Frankenstein that claims as its victims the reputations of both writers. The book tells the story of Madeline, a lonely girl who tries to commit suicide. When, to her relief, the gun jams, she tosses it on a table, causing it to discharge a bullet that flies through her window, crosses the street and kills Starr, a girl rather like herself. Filled with guilt, she digs into her victim's past and when she discovers that Starr has been emotionally slain by an ill-fated marriage, she determines to expiate her own crime by plotting the destruction of Starr's husband. Better editing might have expunged the book's conflicting statements, anachronisms and unbelievable coincidences, but one suspects that Woolrich knew exactly what he was doing when he put it aside. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Baseball Skills &amp; Drills</h2><p><p><br><i>Baseball Skills &amp; Drills</i> is the most comprehensive training book available for coaches and players at all levels.

I was on a walk on a country road in Massachusetts, thinking myopically and somewhat self-regardingly about various offenses that I felt had been perpetrated against me. I was wondering about how apparently trustworthy people could turn dangerous, or if they really had been dangerous all along, merely well-disguised, even from themselves? A standard issue college dorm question, I suppose, but the matter seemed urgent to me that year. I moved from the slightly sore subject of my personal life into the realm of imagination to keep the question alive without it hurting so much, and almost immediately I thought of the Wicked Witch of the West--admittedly, more Margaret Hamilton than L. Frank Baum--and I wondered: Was she always terrible?</p> <p>The momentary crisis of that year, combined with attention to acts of evil and distress in our larger world a few years later, brought me into Oz and the world of <em>Wicked</em>. Still, even eight years later when <em>Wicked</em> was first published, I hadn't expected that the story would remain a presence in the world. I had an imagination big enough to see into every cranny of Oz, but not big enough to imagine that anyone else might get interested, and stay interested.</p> <p>After the story of Elphaba hit the bookstores, the national bestseller lists, the book clubs, and then the Broadway stage, the increasing attention to the story prompted me to go back and follow up the clues I had liberally sprinkled in the first book. <em>Son of a Witch</em> posited that Elphaba and Fiyero had an illegitimate boy, and considered the troubles he would have first growing up with the Witch as a negligent mother and then, even worse, with his negligent mother gone from his life. <em>A Lion Among Men</em> followed up with the Cowardly Lion's tale. Why the Lion and not the Tin Woodman or the Scarecrow, readers ask me. For a number of reasons, but chief among them is that the Lion is an Animal, and Elphaba's concern for the flight of talking Animals makes his life story more urgent to the themes of the Wicked Years sequence.</p> <p>So finally we come to <em>Out of Oz</em>, the fourth and I believe final book in the series. I feel both elated and elegiac to be bringing it to readers. I get to revisit characters I love--Glinda, under house arrest; the Cowardly Lion, on the run from the law; Liir, the Witch's boy; and a little girl growing up in the shadows who may be pivotal to the resolution of military and social struggle in Oz.</p> <p>Oh, and yes--Dorothy too. Dorothy Gale. That Dorothy. She comes on for something more than a curtain call. Face it: you always knew Dorothy was too strong a force to stay buckled down on the Kansas prairie, didn't you? No earthly gravity can hold that girl in one place for long: she defies gravity, too, only without the broomstick.</p> <p>Come for a visit and stay a while. (It's over five hundred pages!) <em>Out of Oz</em> is, I hope, out of this world.</p><p>The stunning conclusion to the smash <em>New York Times</em> bestselling series the Wicked Years</p><p>Hailed as &#x201c;bewitching,&#x201d; &#x201c;remarkable,&#x201d; &#x201c;extraordinary,&#x201d; &#x201c;engrossing,&#x201d; &#x201c;amazing,&#x201d; and &#x201c;delicious,&#x201d; Gregory Maguire&#x2019;s Wicked Years series&#x2014;a sophisticated fantasy cycle inspired by the classic children&#x2019;s novel <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>&#x2014;became national bestsellers and the basis for a hit Tony-winning Broadway musical. Now, Maguire returns with the final installment in his transformative work, a thrilling and compulsively readable saga in which the fate of Oz is decided at last. . . .</p><p>Once peaceful and prosperous, the spectacular Land of Oz is knotted with social unrest: The Emerald City is mounting an invasion of Munchkinland, Glinda is under house arrest, and the Cowardly Lion is on the run from the law.

We see her studying with Catholic missionaries, earning bachelor&#x2019;s and master&#x2019;s degrees in the United States, and becoming the first woman both to earn a PhD in East and Central Africa and to head a university department in Kenya. We witness her numerous run-ins with the brutal Moi government. She makes clear the political and personal reasons that compelled her, in 1977, to establish the Green Belt Movement, which spread from Kenya across Africa and which helps restore indigenous forests while assisting rural women by paying them to plant trees in their villages. We see how Maathai&#x2019;s extraordinary courage and determination helped transform Kenya&#x2019;s government into the democracy in which she now serves as assistant minister for the environment and as a member of Parliament. And we are with her as she accepts the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded in recognition of her &#x201c;contribution to sustainable development, human rights, and peace.&#x201d;<br><br>In <i>Unbowed</i>, Wangari Maathai offers an inspiriting message of hope and prosperity through self-sufficiency.</p><p>'Wangari Maathai is a prophet for our time and Unbowed is a call to arms for all of us who feel that the planet is overwhelmed by careless, corrupt or violent leadership.

Alexandra Fuller <p>In Unbowed, we are in the presence of a hugely charismatic yet humble woman whose remarkable story carries with it an inspiring message of hope. Hers is an extraordinary story, spanning different worlds and changing times, and revealing what the courage, determination, tenacity and humour of one good woman can achieve; how as small a thing as planting a seedling and watering it can made all the difference in the world.

The crusaders' stunning initial success started a sequence of great Crusades, each with its own story, that fundamentally shaped the Christian and Muslim worlds for two centuries, until the last Crusader castles were finally expunged. The energy and commitment that sent army after army into the eastern Mediterranean also led to the invasion and conversion of Central and Baltic Europe, Spain, Portugal, the destruction of the Cathars in Provence and the settlement of America. Told with great verve and authority, God's War is the definitive account of a fascinating but also horrifying story. &#x2018;We are still living with the images and legends of the crusades...Tyerman tells us how the Church set about preaching the crusades, exploiting the perennial pessimism and guilt of the European nobility of the Middle Ages.

Christopher Tyerman&#39;s &#34;God&#39;s War: A New History of the Crusades&#34; is a doorstop of a book, a mammoth effort to retell, based on modern scholarship, the story of how Western Christendom made war to wrest the Holy Lands from Muslim hands. As we all know, this isn&#39;t considered ancient history in the Middle East.--Fritz Lanham &#34;Houston Chronicle &#34; A magisterial work...it is a shoo-in to become this generation&#39;s definitive history of the original Crusades, a series of military expeditions that temporarily returned the Holy Land to Christian rule in the Middle Ages.

It deflates comparisons of current U.S. strategies with the Crusades. True, the participation of religious in battle (like Odo on the Bayeux Tapestry) is noteworthy, but so is Tyerman&#39;s questioning of the cliche &#39;Age of Faith.&#39; Indeed, while these books make the Middle Ages seem real, they also make it seem different, and our capacity to entertain the differences is morally crucial.--Tom D&#39;Evelyn &#34;Providence Journal &#34; Christopher Tyerman, who teaches medieval history in Oxford, offers in his new and massive study of the Crusades as a whole a welcome synthesis for the general reader...Full of fascinating detail...&#34;God&#39;s War&#34; is a first-rate, scholarly, up-to-date, and highly readable survey of the entire crusading movement...In the gullible age of &#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34;, Tyerman offers a sane, informed, and gripping account of one of the most characteristic and most extraordinary manifestations of the Christian Middle Ages.--Eamon Duffy&#34;New York Review of Books&#34; (10/19/2006) With rekindled controversy about Western invasions of the Middle East, the Crusades of the late Middle Ages take on unanticipated relevance. It is thus a real boon for this strikingly effective book to appear at this time. The key to Tyerman&#39;s signal success is his ability to explain both the vicious brutality and the serious Christian altruism that were so intimately intertwined in the crusading experience and that have left such a tangled legacy for Muslim-Christian relations to this day.--Mark A. Noll&#34;Christian Century&#34; (10/17/2006) Anyone who likes knights, castles and battles as much as I do will enjoy Christopher Tyerman&#39;s masterpiece &#34;God&#39;s War&#34;, a history of the Crusades written with great breadth, clarity and human sympathy: one of the achievements of the year.--Dominic Sandbrook&#34;Daily Telegraph&#34; (12/09/2006) Tyerman, an Oxford scholar, combines vigorous argument and nuanced analysis in this deeply learned chronicle of the Crusades...It&#39;s the best single-volume treatment of this still-controversial and fraught subject.--Benjamin Healy and Benjamin Schwarz&#34;The Atlantic&#34; (11/01/2006) This thick book compares favorably to Sir Steven Runciman&#39;s three-volume &#34;A History of the Crusades&#34; (1951-54), but where Runciman, writing a half century ago, saw the Crusades as Christianity&#39;s moral failure, Tyerman sees a violent era: neither Christians nor Moslems were peaceful, and both faced dangerous enemies...In addition to persuasive revisionist interpretations of individual crusades, Tyerman treats the broader scope of crusading, including Spain, the Balkans, and the Baltic. Most importantly for historians, the author sees nothing in the Crusades than can inform modem politics.--W. L. Urban&#34;Choice&#34; (03/01/2007) &#34;God&#39;s War&#34; is a long but highly readable account of this extensive back-and-forth struggle. It is an impressive achievement, a work that manages to tie together an extraordinary number of threads across nearly half a millennium of European history. Although it can be taken as a response to Pope Benedict XVI&#39;s comments at Regensburg, it is more properly read as an extended rejoinder to Steven Runciman&#39;s classic three-volume &#34;History of the Crusades,&#34; published in the early 1950s, a long and colorful account that is nonetheless studded with judgments that now seem prejudiced and amateurish. Tyerman, by contrast, is never amateurish. His knowledge of the period is encyclopedic, and his judgments are sharp, astute, and fair--which is to say unsparing--to both camps. He neither vilifies Islam nor engages in the easy Euro-bashing that is the obverse of Islamophobia. With so many people succumbing to subjectivism these days, it is bracing to come across a historian who remains resolutely abo Challenging traditional conceptions of the Crusades, e.g., the failure to retain Jerusalem, Tyerman believes that it was the weakening of papal power and the rise of secular governments in Europe that finally doomed the crusading impulse. This is a marvelously conceived, written, and supported book.--Robert J. Andrews&#34;Library Journal&#34; (09/15/2006) &#34;God&#39;s War&#34; is the new standard in the field...Adjectives for [it] almost fail. &#34;Comprehensive,&#34; &#34;monumental,&#34; and &#34;epic&#34; come to mind, and they are appropriate but scarcely adequate. In brief, this is a work by a master historian.--Alfred J.

He is the author of <i>The Double Life of Stephen Crane</i> (1992) and <i>Emily Dickinson and the Problem of Others</i> (1984). He is the recipient of Guggenheim and National Endowment for the Humanities fellowships.This lifeless account of Edgar Degas's 1872 visit to New Orleans unsuccessfully tries to link his artistic breakthrough with the city's Reconstruction-era social turmoil. Benfey (American Literature/Mt. Holyoke Coll.; The Double Life of Stephen Crane, 1992) claims the French painter's five-month sojourn with his mother's family ``is something of a legend in New Orleans.'' There's nothing legendary in Benfey's workaday account. A private man bent on being ``famous but unknown,'' Degas stayed indoors because his eyesight (which he fancied was failing) couldn't stand the intense southern light; he pined for black models but painted family members instead. Admitting the challenge posed by his ``notoriously secret'' subject, Benfey expands his critical field of vision to encompass New Orleans writers George Washington Cable and Kate Chopin--even though there's no evidence they crossed paths with Degas. Their work, obsessed with the enormous changes transforming New Orleans society in the Civil War's aftermath, is supposed to help us ``decipher the underlying meanings in Degas paintings and letters.'' Chopin gets top billing, but the largely forgotten Cable gets more ink, including a provocative but unsubstantiated suggestion that this creator of the archetypal ``tragic mulatto'' is the granddaddy of southern literature. Benfey, the first biographer to focus on Degas's American roots, adds valuable insight to the artist's work with his analysis of the effects American technology, architecture, and commerce had on his paintings. But Benfey's glosses of Chopin and Cable don't bring Degas into sharper focus; they push the enigmatic Frenchman further to the edges of an already sprawling, speculative biography. Conjecture about the psychological root of Degas's racial ambivalence--namely the possibility of black blood in the American side of the family--is overstated and underdocumented. Ambitious, perhaps, but Benfey's wide net nevertheless allows his primary subject to slip away, lost in a fog of lit-crit theory and psychobabble.

We at BFB respect his work and are so pleased to be publishing several of his titles. Three of his books, including <i>Hitler</i> and <i>Stalin: Russia's Man of Steel</i>, were <i>School Library Journal</i> Best Books of the Year.Grade 9 Up-- This unflinching look at the Vietnam War is very different from the usual geopolitical histories often written for this age group. Marrin shows readers how the war affected both countries, opening with an excellent background history of Vietnam and a brief biography of Ho Chi Minh. He also describes the sights, sounds, and smells of war, as well as the endless horror of death and torture that was so characteristic of it. He takes readers on missions with both armies, and on bombing runs with the U. S. Air Force. All of this makes for fascinating reading; few books for YAs are as honest as this one. Many histories of this conflict set out to prove that one side or the other was good or evil; Marrin, in contrast, makes it very clear that in this war there were no such absolutes. In great detail and with objectivity, he exposes the brutality of both Vietnamese governments, the cruelty of the Communists, the unrealistic expectations and decisions of President Johnson, and the hypocrisy of the war protesters in the U. S.

Besides, an unmarried daughter of twenty-six is a fearful reproach to someone of her generation.&#x201d; Daisy heard herself babbling but couldn&#x2019;t stop. After all, she had never been married before, and it felt most peculiar. &#x201c;Where Mother&#x2019;s concerned,&#x201d; she continued, &#x201c;it doesn&#x2019;t hurt that <i>your</i> mother disapproves of me quite as much as mine disapproves of you.&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid so,&#x201d; he admitted, &#x201c;but Belinda adores you. Almost as much as I do.&#x201d;When he looked at her like that, it was hard to believe those grey eyes were capable of making an erring subordinate snap to attention or freezing a criminal to the marrow of his bones. &#x201c;Alec, my hat!&#x201d; she squeaked, as he enveloped her in a crushing embrace.Though she was unable to speak for several minutes, her ears were unencumbered. She distinctly heard Bill Truscott chuckle as he drove the Vauxhall, its hood down on this sparkling October day, towards the Dorchester Hotel. That was the worst of old retainers.The loan of the motor and chauffeur was the least of what Daisy&#x2019;s cousin Edgar, Lord Dalrymple, had provided. He had done them proud, in spite of the short notice. Coming over all dynastic, he had begged to give the bride away and to provide a bang-up reception. Daisy hadn&#x2019;t had the heart to refuse, knowing how guilty the ex-schoolmaster felt at having inherited Fairacres and the viscountcy after her father&#x2019;s death in the &#x2019;flu pandemic of &#x2019;19.Her father ought to have been there to give her hand to Alec, he or her brother, Gervaise, killed in the Flanders trenches. And it might have been Michael who placed the ring on her finger, if that land-mine had not blown up his Friends&#x2019; Ambulance Unit. A catch in her throat, Daisy blinked.She loved Alec dearly, but her sight was misty as she glanced back at the following motor-cars. The first bore Cousin Edgar, the Dowager Lady Dalrymple, and Daisy&#x2019;s maid of honour, her erstwhile housemate, Lucy Fotheringay. The second, Alec&#x2019;s cherished Austin &#x201c;Chummy,&#x201d; was driven by his sergeant, Tom Tring, who had stood as his best man. In the back seat, Mrs. Fletcher sat poker-stiff with Alec&#x2019;s ten-year-old daughter, Belinda, bouncing slightly at her side.It was a small wedding party, just what Daisy had wanted but not at all what her mother considered proper.&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll never forgive me the Registry Office,&#x201d; Daisy sighed, &#x201c;since she had her heart set on St. George&#x2019;s, Hanover Square. Darling, I&#x2019;m frightfully glad Superintendent Crane gave you so little notice of your fortnight&#x2019;s leave.&#x201d;&#x201c;So am I, since it pleases you, love.&#x201d; Alec&#x2019;s dark, rather fierce eyebrows met in a frown. &#x201c;Yet I have a nasty feeling he&#x2019;s got something up his sleeve.&#x201d;&#x201c;Oh, Alec, he <i>can&#x2019;t</i> ask you to investigate a crime while we&#x2019;re on our honeymoon!&#x201d;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I suggested a week in Jersey. The Channel Islands have their own legal system, which is none of our business. And I haven&#x2019;t mentioned to anyone at the Yard that we&#x2019;ll spend the second week at home. No, I suspect the Super has something special in store for when I go back to work.&#x201d;&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not worry about it now, then, darling. Oh, here we are. You squashed my flowers. Is my hat straight?&#x201d;The reception was on a completely different scale from the wedding. In spite of the short notice, few of those invited failed to attend. The Dorchester&#x2019;s ballroom was crammed with Daisy&#x2019;s aristocratic family connections, Alec&#x2019;s Metropolitan Police colleagues, and an eclectic collection of friends.Daisy made friends easily and, according to her mother, without discrimination. Standing in the receiving line, the Dowager Lady Dalrymple was forced to shake hands with, among others, an Indian doctor, an American industrialist, and a Russian Jewish violinist.&#x201c;I knew if you insisted on working for a living you were bound to meet the most unsuitable people,&#x201d; she moaned, &#x201c;but need you make <i>friends</i> of them?&#x201d;&#x201c;Buck up, Mother,&#x201d; Daisy whispered. &#x201c;Here come Lord and Lady Wentwater. I wrote an article about Wentwater Court, remember?&#x201d;In spite of their unfortunate connection with her work, an earl and countess could not fail to please. For the moment at least, Daisy was spared further reproaches.Another &#x201c;suitable&#x201d; guest was the Honourable Phillip Petrie, who had grown up on the estate next to Fairacres. Lady Dalrymple&#x2019;s only objection to him was that he had not married Daisy. It was not for want of trying. As Gervaise&#x2019;s closest chum, he had long felt honour-bound to take care of Gervaise&#x2019;s little sister, which led him to propose to her at regular intervals.Daisy having refused him with equal regularity, he had recently married an American girl. He appeared to be utterly besotted with his golden-headed Gloria, whom he generally addressed&#x2014;revoltingly&#x2014;as Glow-worm.<br>&nbsp;Later on, after cutting the wedding cake, Daisy and Alec were talking to Phillip and Gloria when Gloria&#x2019;s father, Mr. Arbuckle, approached. Curiously, he was accompanied by Detective Superintendent Crane, with whom he appeared to be on unnaturally friendly terms.They were an oddly assorted pair, and the uniform of formal morning cutaways and striped trousers only served to accentuate the contrast. The American millionaire was short and spare, his long face lengthened by a receding hair-line. The English policeman stood well above the regulation height, his bulk still muscular (thrice weekly games of fives, according to Alec), his sandy hair fading but still thick.Mr. Arbuckle looked smug, Superintendent Crane bland in a way Daisy had long since concluded all detectives must practise in front of their looking-glasses. She regarded him with suspicion.&#x201c;He <i>does</i> have something up his sleeve,&#x201d; she muttered.Catching her words, Gloria glanced back. &#x201c;Yes, Poppa&#x2019;s been up to something,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what, but he&#x2019;s in cahoots with Superintendent Crane, I do believe. I&#x2019;ve seen them with their heads together, haven&#x2019;t you, honey?&#x201d;Phillip&#x2019;s conventionally handsome face remained blank. In anyone she knew less well, Daisy might have supposed he was aware of whatever plot was hatching and was attempting to conceal his knowledge. In Phillip, however, blankness of face denoted blankness of mind. Put him down in front of a motor-car engine and his capabilities amounted to near genius, according to his poppa-in-law. Little else, always excepting his young bride, was able to stir his brain cells into action.&#x201c;Er, yes,&#x201d; he agreed uncertainly, smoothing his already sleek, fair head.Arbuckle and Crane were upon them. The usual congratulations for the groom and wishes for the bride&#x2019;s happiness were repeated. During the brief pause that followed, Daisy caught a hint of embarrassment marring the Super&#x2019;s placid fa�ade. He turned his head towards his fellow conspirator.&#x201c;Waal, have I got a surprise for you folks,&#x201d; said Arbuckle, beaming. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m tickled to death, Fletcher, to be able to tell you I&#x2019;ve been pulling strings in Washington on your account. See, our noo President, Mr. Coolidge, wants to clean up the Investigation Bureau of the Justice Department&#x2014;that&#x2019;s like our national police&#x2014;and boy oh boy, do they need it! Orgian stables isn&#x2019;t in it, trust me.&#x201d;He smirked, pleased with himself at this classical reference. After a momentary vision of mounted police indulging in orgies, Daisy translated it as Augean stables. Her school had not considered Greek and Latin suitable for feeble female minds, but tales from the myths, properly bowdlerized, were staples.&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard rumours,&#x201d; Alec admitted with caution.&#x201c;Graft&#x2019;s the word, right from the top. Burns, the Director, has been using federal employees to run his own &#x2019;tec agency. Waal, to cut a long story short, I got put onto this smart young guy who&#x2019;ll likely end up as the boss man. I talked to him on the transatlantic telephone and convinced him he needed to consult with Scotland Yard.&#x201d;&#x201c;And the S�ret�,&#x201d; put in Superintendent Crane dryly.&#x201c;Gotta be fair to our gallant allies, sir, or at least look like it. Anyways, as I was about to say, there&#x2019;s no police department back in the States that&#x2019;s worth a dime, not when it comes to big ideas for organizing things on a sound, honest basis. And once I&#x2019;d talked round this J. Edgar Hoover guy, your Commissioner was easy as pie.&#x201d;&#x201c;I hope you won&#x2019;t let him hear you say that!&#x201d; Crane exclaimed, not a little put out.&#x201c;All I mean is, he&#x2019;s a reasonable guy,&#x201d; Arbuckle hastened to assure him.Daisy, the sinking feeling in her stomach reaching rock-bottom, decided it was time to learn the worst. &#x201c;But what was the Commissioner reasonable about?&#x201d; she demanded.Arbuckle beamed at her, triumphant. &#x201c;Why, first he agreed to send a man over to advise young J. Edgar, and then he agreed that Detective Chief Inspector Fletcher is the best man for the job.&#x201d;&#x201c;But we&#x2019;re only just married!&#x201d; Daisy wailed, seizing Alec&#x2019;s arm and hanging on tight. Alec put his hand over hers and opened his mouth, but Gloria got in first.&#x201c;Poppa, how could you!&#x201d;&#x201c;Now, now, honey, let your old poppa finish. I&#x2019;m mighty sorry, Mrs. Fletcher&#x2014;I should&#x2019;ve started at the other end. You&#x2019;re going too, see, all expenses paid.&#x201d;&#x201c;Oh, but I couldn&#x2019;t possibly accept ...&#x201d;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not me that&#x2019;s paying, not but what I would, and be happy to. I owe you big, you and Fletcher, and don&#x2019;t you think I&#x2019;ll ever forget it. While you&#x2019;re in the States, I surely hope&#x2014;we hope, don&#x2019;t we, honey?&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll be our guests at my little country place.&#x201d;&#x201c;Gee, sure thing, Poppa. That&#x2019;s a swell idea.&#x201d;&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll all sail together on the SS <i>Talavera.</i> But there&#x2019;re others than me glad to pay your fare, Mrs. Fletcher. Yes siree, I&#x2019;ve been talking to your editors, here in Lunnon and over in Manhattan. Here&#x2019;s a cable from N&#x2018;York and a letter from the Lunnon guy. You&#x2019;ll see both of &#x2019;em want articles about the voyage and your impressions of America.&#x201d;Daisy was speechless, thrilled certainly, yet nettled at being manipulated. While she scanned the two messages, Alec turned to Crane.&#x201c;I was promised two weeks&#x2019; leave, sir,&#x201d; he said flatly.The Superintendent&#x2019;s face remained bland, but he had a twinkle in his eye. &#x201c;Keep your hair on,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You get a nice week&#x2019;s sea cruise each way, courtesy of H.M. Government; and what&#x2019;s more, it&#x2019;s a bonus. The <i>Talavera</i> leaves Liverpool on the Wednesday after you&#x2019;re due back on duty.&#x201d;&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d; Alec remained cautious. &#x201c;What about this invitation to stay with Arbuckle?&#x201d;&#x201c;Your return voyage is booked. If you finish in Washington before the time&#x2019;s up, what you do next is up to you.&#x201d; Drawing Alec a little aside, Crane lowered his voice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you this in confidence. Arbuckle has a certain amount of influence over here, and we can&#x2019;t ignore a request from the American Government. However, what persuaded the A.C. to let you go for so long is the prospect of six weeks without Mrs. Fletcher&#x2019;s getting herself mixed up in any investigations.&#x201d;&#x201c;My mother ...? Oh, Daisy!&#x201d;Crane chuckled. &#x201c;Anything she does in America is out of <i>our</i> jurisdiction; and whatever happens there, <i>you</i> will at least have peace on board ship.&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Alec said hopefully, &#x201c;she can&#x2019;t possibly get into trouble aboard.&#x201d;TO DAVY JONES BELOW.

Would you expect anything less from the mystery man behind A Series of Unfortunate Events (<i>The Bad Beginning</i>, <i>The Ersatz Elevator</i>, etc.)? Virtually every detail of the volume has Snicket's indelible mark, from the book jacket (reversible to help readers disguise this "extremely dangerous" and "objectionable" autobiography) to the copyright page text to the intentionally blurry and bewildering black-and-white photographs appearing throughout. An apparently false obituary for Lemony Snicket sets the stage for what turns into a series of mind-boggling bundles of coded information passed from hand to hand, gleaned from newspapers blowing through streets, pages from a journal addressed to "Dear Dairy," blueprints of ships, minutes from secret meetings, and a lot of edited and disputed commentary. The question is, do we finally discover the meaning of VFD? You know you're not going to get a straight answer. But any fan of Snicket will have a lot of fun trying. (Ages 9 and older) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i><p>A Warning from the Publisher: </p><p>Many readers have questions about Lemony Snicket, author of the distressing serial concerning the trials of the charming but unlucky Baudelaire orphans, published under the collective title A Series of Unfortunate Events. Before purchasing, borrowing, or stealing this book, you should be aware that it contains the answers to some of those questions, such as the following: </p><p>1. Who is Lemony? </p><p>2. Is there a secret organization I should know about? </p><p>3. Why does Lemony Snicket spend his time researching and writing distressing books concerning the Baudelaire orphans? </p><p>4. Why do all of Lemony Snicket's books contain a sad dedication to a woman named Beatrice? </p><p>5. If there's nothing out there, what was that noise? </p><p>Our advice to you is that you find a book that answers less upsetting questions than this one. Perhaps your librarian, bookseller, or parole officer can recommend a book that answers the question, "Aren't ponies adorable?" </p></p><h2>Dumb-Bell of Brookfield, Pocono Shot, and Other Great Dog Stories</h2><p>Some of the most memorable dog stories ever.<br></p><p>"Dumb-Bell of Brookfield," "Pocono Shot," "Trub's Diary," "Allegheny," "Jing," "Dog Upon the Waters," and "The White Grouse" rank with the best and most memorable stories ever written about dogs.

The most remarkable and most popular account of WWII aviation depicts the 8th from its arrival in Britain in 1942, to its spread across the country to operate from over 40 bases, on the way to becoming the largest air unit ever committed to battle. An extensively detailed and fully researched account covers intensive bomber and fighter sorties over Europe conducted by over 2,000 aircraft involving over 150,000 men. The exploits of B-17s, B-26s, and P-47s are told, along with little-known explanations of the vastly sophisticated supply chain that kept them flying. Over 700 photos of planes on the ground and in battle action depict formations and strategies, while over 150 full-color illustrations display aircraft group markings. <br></p><p>As a boy, Roger Freeman watched from his father&#39;s farm as the 8th Air Force took off for its missions over Germany; he has had a lifelong interest in the Mighty Eighth ever since, and now lectures on USAAF history, both here and in America.</p><h2>By the Light of My Father&#39;s Smile: A Novel</h2><p><b>By the Light of My Father's Smile</b> is Alice Walker's first novel in six years--a stunning, original, and important book by "one of the best American writers of today" (The Washington Post).<br><br>A family from the United States goes to the remote Sierras in Mexico--the writer-to-be, Susannah; her sister, Magdalena; her father and mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;And there, amid an endangered band of mixed-race Blacks and Indians called the Mundo, they begin an encounter that will change them more than they could ever dream.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving back and forth in time, and among unforgettable characters and their stories, Walker crosses conventional borders of all kinds as she explores in this magical novel the ways in which a woman's denied sexuality leads to the loss of the much prized and necessary original self; and how she regains that self, even as her family's past of lies and love is transformed.<br><br> <b>By the Light of My Father's Smile</b> presents, as Alice Walker puts it, "a celebration of sexuality, its absolute usefulness in the accessing of one's mature spirituality, and the father's role in assuring joy or sorrow in this arena for his female children."&nbsp;&nbsp;It explores the richness and coherence of alternative culture, experience of sexuality as a celebration of life, of trust in Nature and the Spirit, even as it affirms the belief, as Walker says, "that it is the triumphant heart, not the conquered heart, that forgives.&nbsp;&nbsp;And that love is both timeless and beyond time."</p><p>The Mundo are a new tribe, created by the intermingling of escaped Black slaves and native Indians in the Mexican Sierras. Ineligible for academic funding, a husband-and-wife team of African American anthropologists pose as Christian missionaries to secure sponsorship to live among the Mundo and study their culture. This soul-stifling deception underlies the family tragedy at the heart of Alice Walker's novel, her first in six years. The father, preaching the message of his puritanical Protestant sponsors, is "sucked into the black cloth" of Christianity and blinded to the Mundo's life-affirming ways. When he discovers his daughter Magdalena's affair with a young Mundo, he beats her with a belt, thus estranging himself from both her and the younger daughter, Susannah. The first of several narrative voices to speak is his. Dead, he has become an "angel" who observes his daughters from the "other side" and seeks to make amends for the pain he inflicted on them in life. <p> It is the conceit of <i>By the Light of My Father's Smile</i> that angels have complete access to the consciousness of the living beings they observe. One of the book's very first scenes involves the ebullient lovemaking of Susannah and her partner, Pauline, reported in sweaty detail by the angelic paternal voyeur. Highly explicit, this set piece is a kind of guerrilla assault on our sensibilities, preparing us to receive Walker's urgent message--that sexuality and spirituality are inextricable, that denying one causes the other to atrophy as well. The blessings of fathers are, according to this canon, essential to the sexual flowering and spiritual maturity of their female offspring. It is in the loss, the conferring, and the claiming of these blessings that the novel finds its narrative thrust.</p><p> <i>By the Light of My Father's Smile</i> is intended perhaps less as a story than as a parable presenting Walker's cosmology for the new millennium--one that synthesizes ancient and modern wisdoms in a way that's as artistically daring as it is politically correct: Sex is good, repression is evil. Dominant is bad, distaff is good. European culture is dead meat, the third world is wise, there is ongoing commerce between the living and the dead, great orgasms shall set us free. Many readers will agree that a world built upon these precepts surely would be preferable to the one we now inhabit. Here, as in previous fictions, Walker the storyteller is spellbinding, Walker the preacher-theorist, less so. On the other hand, what other novelist risks so bravely or with such generosity, and seeks to give so much? With the proper mindset, Walker assures us, anyone can become a member of the Mundo tribe. <i>--Joyce Thompson</i></p>Praise for Possessing the Secret of Joy<br><br>"A remarkable novel." --Newsweek<br><br>"A writer of staggering talent." --New York Newsday</p><h2>Invisible Life: Special edition</h2><p>Available at last, E. Lynn Harris's beloved first novel in a hardcover edition.<br><br>Just a few years ago, E. Lynn Harris was selling his self-published novel <b>Invisible Life</b> out of the back of his car. Today he is a bestselling publishing sensation, with more than one million copies of his four novels sold. To celebrate Harris's incredible success, and offer his fans the opportunity to own, at last, a hardcover version of <b>Invisible Life</b>, Doubleday is proud to announce a special edition of the book so many have cherished.<br><br><b>Invisible Life</b> is the story of a young man's coming of age. Law school, girlfriends, and career choices were all part of Raymond Tyler's life, but there were other, more terrifying issues for him to confront. Being black was tough enough, but Raymond was becoming more and more conscious of&nbsp;&nbsp;sexual feelings that he knew weren't "right." He was completely committed to Sela, his longtime girlfriend, but his attraction to Kelvin, whom he had met during his last year in law school, had become more than just a friendship. No matter how much he tried to suppress them, his feelings were deeply sexual.<br><br>Fleeing to New York to escape both Sela and Kelvin, Raymond finds himself more confused than ever before. New relationships--both male and female--give him enormous pleasure but keep him from finding the inner peace and lasting love he so desperately desires. The horrible illness and death of a friend force Raymond, at last, to face the truth.<br><br><b>Invisible Life</b> has been hailed as "one of the most thought-provoking books--since James Baldwin's Another Country" (<b>Richmond Voice</b>), and Harris's "stories have become the toast of bookstores, reading groups, men, women, and gay and straight people" (<b>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</b>).<br><br>Proceeds from the sale of this special fifth anniversary edition will go to the E. Lynn Harris Foundation, a charitable organization that gives young people across the country the opportunity to study writing with established authors, and also aids emerging artists.</p><p>E. Lynn Harris's track record as a bestselling novelist began here, with the story of Raymond Tyler, who, after years of questioning his sexual identity, finds himself torn between a married male lover and Nicole, the talented actress with whom he imagines himself able to spend the rest of his life. With a rich cast of supporting characters and emotionally wrenching plot twists, this debut proved popular enough in a self-published edition to catch the attention of Doubleday, which bought the rights to <i>Invisible Life</i> and has published each of Harris's four subsequent novels, including two sequels, <i>Just As I Am</i> and <i>Abide with Me</i>.The re-issue of a remarkable first novel by a young, gay, black author who has fashioned a deeply moving and compelling coming of age story out of the highly controversial issues of bisexuality and AIDS.</p><h2>Reckless (Highland Brides)</h2><p>Heir to the clan MacFarlane, Ailis was a prize to be bartered by her calculating father, and her wedding to a man she despised seemed inevitable--until she is abducted by her clan's worst enemy, Alexander MaDubh, a brutally handsome laird with ice in his eyes and hot blood in his veins. <br><br>Alexander had come riding into Leargan to claim the three children born of a forbidden love between his brother and lovely Ailis' sister. Now, with Ailis herself as his pawn, he can strike at the enemy whose treachery robbed his clan of so much.

But will a passion they cannot deny be enough to ease the pain and torment of the past? <br><br><b>Praise for Hannah Howell and her Highland novels. . .</b><br><br>"Few authors portray the Scottish highlands as lovingly or colorfully as Hannah Howell." --<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"Expert storyteller Howell pens another Highland winner." --<i>Romantic Times </i></p><p><b>Hannah Howell</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> bestselling author of acclaimed historical romances.

Security&#x2013;that confidence in the future that springs from one's own ability, forethought, and preparation&#x2013;and adventure&#x2013;the soaring sense of "anything is possible" and "there are so many interesting things to try"&#x2013;are well known to those who grow new varieties, experiment with new methods, and save their own seeds.<br><br>Skill in raising vegetable plants from seed is the very cornerstone of gardening independence. Choice of seeds and careful handling can bring you not only earlier harvests but also better vegetables. You can select varieties of food known to keep or process well so that the winter season, for which we gardeners are always planning, will be a time of abundance. Likewise, good eating will be yours all summer long from the selection of fresh vegetables you've planted for their superior quality.<br><br>THE REASONS<br><br>I suspect that I'd continue to raise my own seedlings even without a good excuse, because I enjoy the process. But when I stop to think about it, I realize that there are all kinds of good reasons for growing one's own plants from seed.<br><br>Earlier harvests. You can get a much earlier start in the garden, and therefore put fresh food on the table sooner, when you've grown cabbage, tomato, eggplant, and pepper plants indoors for setting out when weather mellows. The sooner you can begin picking from your garden, the greater your yield for the year.<br><br>Greater variety. Varieties of plants offered by commercial seedling vendors represent but a tiny fraction of the possibilities open to you as a gardener. Buying started plants severely limits your options for raising vegetables of special flavor, insect or disease resistance, or extra nutritional value. If, for example, you want to grow late-blight-resistant tomatoes such as 'Plum Regal', 'Mountain Magic', and 'Mountain Merit', you'll have to start with seeds. Looking for special gourmet foods like globe artichokes, watercress, or Japanese melons? It's back to the seed catalogs. Peppers that are hot, but not too hot? Start your own Hungarian wax plants. Delicious, mild, sweet 'Golden Acre' or 'Glory of Enkhuizen' cabbage? You need to start those with seeds.<br><br>Stronger seedlings. Seedlings you've grown yourself can be super seedlings. If you do all the right things at the right times, you'll have the best that can be grown, and you'll know that your plants have well-developed roots growing in good soil that hasn't been hyped with chemicals. You can even plant organically raised seeds in organic seed-starting mix to give your plants an extra start on excellence.<br><br>Healthier seedlings. By raising your own plants, you minimize the chance of introducing soilborne diseases to your garden. Clubroots and yellows that affect cabbage, along with anthracnose, tobacco mosaic, and wilt, are some examples of plant diseases you may avoid importing if you grow your own. Of course, you must use uncontaminated seed-starting mix and, in the case of mosaic in pepper, eggplant, and tomato seedlings, avoid handling tobacco around the plants.<br><br>Cost saving. You'll save money. For the price of a dozen greenhouse tomato plants, you can buy a couple of seed packets&#x2013;each of which will give you plants to share or to sell, or extra seeds to save for the following year. But because so many interesting plants can be grown from seed, once you start raising seedlings, you might find that you tend to put some of that saved money back into seeds of other kinds. Since you're likely to eat even better as a result, you may well consider that you're still far ahead.<br><br>Satisfaction. Creative satisfaction ought to count for something, too. From settling a well-chosen seedling in a pot of its own carefully prepared seed-starting mix and watching it grow greener, sturdier, and leafier, to picking and eating the peppers, eggplant, or other nutritious food the mature plant finally bears, you've been involved all the way. You can see that your skillful care has made a difference.<br><br>Some varieties of vegetables and flowers can only be grown from seed.<br><br>Enjoyment. At the very least, planting seeds indoors is a good cure for the winter doldrums&#x2013;those bleak, cold days when February seems like a permanent condition and you feel you simply must do something to nudge the season into turning. Choose your earliest plantings judiciously, though. You don't want them to be past their prime when you set them out in the garden. Onions, chives, peppers, certain wildflowers and perennial plants, and houseplants like coleus and geraniums are good candidates for starting very early.</p><h2>Spytime: The Undoing of James Jesus Angleton</h2><p>James Jesus Angleton was the master-a legend in the time of spies. Founder of U.S. counterintelligence at the end of the second World War, and ruthless hunter of moles and enemies of America, his name is synonymous with skullduggery and intellectual subterfuge. Now bestselling author William F. Buckley Jr. presents a subtle and thrilling fictional account of the spymaster's life. From his early involvement in the World War II underground to the waning days of the Cold War in Washington, D.C., Angleton pursued his enemies, real and imagined, with a cool, calculating intelligence, and an unwillingness to take anything at face value. Convinced that there was a turncoat within the CIA itself, he confused his enemy through misleading acts and deceptive feints to distort his real objective-to capture and expose a traitor. The result was near-victory for American Intelligence-and defeat for himself. A brilliant re-creation of his world, which included the CIA, Soviet defectors, the infamous traitors Burgess, MacLean, and Philby, and American presidents from Truman to Carter, Spytime traces the making-and tragic unmaking-of a man without peer, and at the end, a man without a country to serve.<br></p><p>This fictional account of the life of James Jesus Angleton, founder of the American counterintelligence establishment, will make readers wish for the humor and high jinks of Blackie Oakes, William F. Buckley Jr.'s much more engaging fictional spy. As the novel opens, Angleton is being summarily locked out of the halls of power and plotting his final act: the unmasking of the famed Fifth Man involved in the scandals that rocked England when Guy Burgess, Kim Philby, Donald Maclean, and Anthony Blount were unmasked as traitors. But before he lets the reader in on the identity of the Fifth Man, Buckley traces Angleton's career through his involvement in a number of espionage cases, all rooted in the cold war and apparently chosen to illustrate Buckley's ongoing (and already decided) battle with his favorite nemesis, Soviet communism.<p> Angleton's lifelong obsession with Philby is the engine that drives <i>Spytime</i>, but there are too many miles on it to make what passes for a plot hold the reader's interest. On the brighter side, Buckley's erudition puts a fine polish on the chassis. <i>Cold Warrior</i>, Tom Mangold's fine biography of Angleton, is a more evenhanded treatment of the life of this complicated man, but Buckley's is more fun to take to the beach. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>James Jesus Angleton was an enigma, a secretive man whose power was at its peak during the height of the Cold War. Founder of U.S. counter-intelligence, hunter of moles and foes of America, his name has become synonymous with skulduggery and subterfuge. Angleton pursued his enemies, real and imagined, with a cool, calculating intelligence. Eventually convinced that there was a turncoat within the highest reaches of the U.S. government, Angleton turned all of his considerable skills to finding and exposing him.

The group was stranded, and Manly and another man set out on foot to find help. Fourteen days later they wandered into Mission San Fernando. They returned to their companions with supplies and brought them out of Death Valley to safety. Encouraged by his friends, Manly wrote his remarkable story, detailing his journey and rescue mission.<p>With an introduction by noted historian Patricia Limerick and freshly edited, indexed, and annotated in an unusually handsome edition, <i>Death Valley in '49</i> is both an important book--central to our understanding of early California--and, with its compelling narrative, a joy to read.</p></p><p>William Lewis Manly was born in Vermont in 1820. He and his family moved to Ohio in 1827, and then continued to drift around the country in search of a better life, living in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Maine. In the fall of 1848, Manly decided to follow the gold rush to California. This is the trip documented in Death Valley in '&#x2019;49. Manly moved between California and the East for several years, eventually settling in California, where he mined, married, and settled in San Jose. Manly died in 1903.If you ever wondered how Death Valley earned its ominous name, here are dreadful stories aplenty to satisfy your curiosity. William Manly traversed the area for twelve months around 1849, and was one of the few who lived to tell the tale. According to his narrative, "Many accounts have been given to the world as to the origin of the name and by whom it was thus designated but ours were the first visible footsteps, and we the party which named it the saddest and most dreadful name that came to us first from its memories." <p>The book starts out chronicling the author's early life, including his childhood on a farm on the East Coast, and his subsequent travels to the frontier colonies of Michigan and Wisconsin. He earned a living doing odd jobs, hunting and trapping, and made his way further west until news of the Gold Rush in California reached him and he decided to head out there. He ended up leading a party of emigrant families across the desert to California, and the main part of the narrative tells the long and harrowing tale of that journey. Every step of the way was miserable, and the members of the party often cursed themselves for setting out in the first place: </p><p>"Mrs. Bennett and Mrs. Arcane were in heart-rending distress. The four children were crying for water but there was not a drop to give them, and none could be reached before some time next day. The mothers were nearly crazy, for they expected the children would choke with thirst and die in their arms, and would rather perish themselves than suffer the agony of seeing their little ones gasp and slowly die. They reproached themselves as being the cause of all this trouble. For the love of gold they had left homes where hunger had never come, and often in sleep dreamed of the bounteous tables of their old homes only to be woefully disappointed in the morning." </p><p>Crazed with thirst and starving, the party split up and most of the members perished. Although he could have made it the rest of the way on his own, Manly felt he had to look after the rest of the party: </p><p>"Prospects now seemed to me so hopeless, that I heartily wished I was not in duty bound to stand by the women and small children who could never reach a land of bread without assistance. If I was in the position that some of them were who had only themselves to look after, I could pick up my knapsack and gun and go off, feeling I had no dependent ones to leave behind. But as it was I felt I should be morally guilty of murder if I should forsake Mr. Bennett's wife and children, and the family of Mr. Arcane with whom I had been thus far associated. It was a dark line of thought but I always felt better when I got around to the determination, as I always did, to stand by my friends, their wives and children let come what might"<br>.<br>In order to save the others, the author and one other man struck out alone to see if they could bring back help. They made it to California, where they found water and endless green fields. In a remarkably brave and selfless gesture, he went back to rescue what might be left of the party, although they had little hope that anyone would still be alive: </p><p>"No signs of life were anywhere about, and the thought of our hard struggles between life and death to go out and return, with the fruitless results that now seemed apparent was almost more than human heart could bear. When should we know their fate? When should we find their remains, and how learn of their sad history if we ourselves should live to get back again to settlements and life? If ever two men were troubled, Rogers and I surely passed through the furnace." </p><p>However, two of the original families were still alive, and the men succeeded in leading them to their destination after many more trials. Besides the sad and desperate tale of this particular party, the author also relates the stories of various other emigrant groups, including the 'Jayhawkers', a group of young men who set out west to find gold. This book is a must-read for anyone interested in desert pioneering.</p></p><h2>Look Inside Trains</h2><p>From traditional steam trains to super-fast bullet trains, trams and funicular railways, children will love lifting the flaps to discover how different types of trains work.

Here are Moon and Half Dome, Clearing Winter Storm, and El Capitan, Winter, Sunrise - images that have become veritable icons of the American wilderness.

Which is where this novel comes in. Based on an original outline by series creator J. Michael Straczynski and following <i>Dark Genesis: The Birth of the Psi Corps</i>, it is the second novel of a trilogy detailing the history of the Psi Corps. Yet it is sufficiently self-contained to be accessible to readers unfamiliar with <i>B5</i>. <p> The book chronicles the life of the Psi Corps Alfred Bester from boyhood to the dramatic events that will first take him to the eponymous space station. As befits the show, <i>Deadly Relations</i> is complex and well characterized, aware of SF history, and filled with fascinating background detail. J. Gregory Keyes portrays Bester's paradoxical nature: a man haunted and lonely, able to read the thoughts of others, and capable of betraying those closest to him out of a sense of duty to the greater good. A sinister, ruthless figure becomes a sympathetic, almost tragic antihero as the book ranges from Earth to the Beta Colony and Mars. </p><p> The fictional Alfred Bester had a real-life namesake who authored several major SF novels. These include the still extraordinary 1953 thriller of murder and psychic detection, to which <i>Deadly Relations</i> pays due homage. If you enjoy <i>B5</i>, try <i>The Demolished Man</i> by the original Alfred Bester. It's a genuine SF classic. <i>--Gary S. Dalkin, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Born in Meridian, Mississippi, in 1963, J. Gregory Keyes spent his early years roaming the forests of his native state and the red rock cliffs of the Navajo Indian reservation in Arizona. He earned a B.A. in anthropology from Mississippi State University and a master's degree from the University of Georgia, where he did course work for a Ph.D. He and his wife, Nell, live in Seattle, where, in addition to full-time writing, he practices ethnic cooking--particularly Central American, Szechuan, Malaysian, and Turkish cuisine. Since moving to the Northwest, he can no longer participate in his favorite sport--Kapucha Toli, a Choctaw game involving heavy sticks and few rules--so he has taken up fencing. Greg is the author of The Waterborn, The Blackgod, and Newton's Cannon.<br><br>J. Michael Straczynski is one of the most prolific and highly regarded writers currently working in the television industry. In 1995, he was selected by Newsweek magazine as one of their Fifty for the Future, described as innovators who will shape our lives as we move into the twenty-first century. His work spans every conceivable genre--from historical dramas and adaptations of famous works of literature (The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde) to mystery series (Murder, She Wrote), cop shows (Jake and the Fatman), anthology series (The Twilight Zone), and science fiction (Babylon 5). He writes ten hours a day, seven days a week, except for his birthday, New Year's, and Christmas.</p><h2>The Best of Fons &amp; Porter: Scrap Quilts (Leisure Arts #5297)</h2><p>Scrappy quilts continue to grow in popularity today, being the ultimate "green" recycling project as well as offering quilters a thrifty way to keep quilting in tough economic times. This big collection of quilts represents more than 20 favorite scrap-friendly projects from issues of Fons &amp; Porter's Love of Quilting magazine. Patterns suitable for using fabric fat quarters and fat eighths are specially identified.

Yet the Europeans learned what they wished to learn&#x2015;not necessarily what the natives actually meant by their stories and their lives&#x2015;says Calvin Luther Martin in this unique and powerfully insightful book. By focusing on their own questions, Martin observes, those arriving in the New World have failed to grasp the deepest meaning of Native America.<br><br>Drawing on his own experiences with native people and on their stories, Martin brings us to a new conceptual landscape&#x2015;the mythworld that seems unfamiliar and strange to those accustomed to western ways of thinking. He shows how native people understand the world and how human beings can and should conduct themselves within it. Taking up the profound philosophical challenge of the Native American &#x201c;way of the human being,&#x201d; <br><br>Martin leads us to rethink our entire sense of what is real and how we know the real.</p><p>Calvin Luther Martin lives and writes in the Adirondacks in upstate New York. His book Keepers of the Game: Indian Animal Relationships and the Fur Trade received the American Historical Association&#39;s Albert J. Beveridge Award. His new book, The Way of the Human Being, is due out in 1999.Having spent a summer on a Navajo reservation and having lived among Yup'ik Eskimos in Alaska for two years, Martin has written a searching exploration of Native American ways of being and seeing. The Navajo, reports this former Rutgers history professor, "see man and woman intertwined, yin and yang, between them accomplishing the purposes of the earth, housing the powerful events of the landscape and firmament surrounding them." Traditional Eskimos don't talk about "nature," "conservation" or "environment," he surmises, "because they are nature; they are coterminous with the mind, the spirit, the being of it all. This is being a real person." Yet Native cultures, in his assessment, have been grievously fragmented. The Eskimos, for example, a people who once synthesized the cosmos through their music and dance, their clothing, homes and tools, even their names, have been psychologically devastated by the impact of Western civilization, with its "severed intellect" detached from nature. From Winnebago Trickster tales, Martin teases out lessons on the need for equilibrium and modesty. Blending insights from N. Scott Momaday, Leslie Marmon Silko and Loren Eiseley, and quoting liberally from early European explorers' journals, he plumbs the perceptual divide that he has found between natives and non-natives. He intriguingly speculates that the outlook of quantum physics, while starkly different from our controlled, materialist reality, is in some ways congruent with the Native American relativistic and sentient cosmos. These deeply personal essays represent an engaging departure from Martin's more academic books on Native America. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Footprints In The Dew</h2><p>On the run from the law for 16 years Damon &#34;Chub&#34; Anderson for sixteen years was almost a forgotten man until June 15, 2006 when he was arrested in Helena Montana for jumping bond on charges in Kansas.

And yet the environmental crisis is only getting worse. In <i>The Vanishing Face of Gaia</i>, the eminent scientist James Lovelock argues that the earth is lurching ever closer to a permanent &#x201c;hot state&#x201d; &#x2013; and much more quickly than most specialists think. There is nothing humans can do to reverse the process; the planet is simply too overpopulated to halt its own destruction by greenhouse gases.<p>In order to survive, mankind must start preparing now for life on a radically changed planet. The meliorist approach outlined in the Kyoto Treaty must be abandoned in favor of nuclear energy and aggressive agricultural development on the small areas of earth that will remain arable.</p><p>A reluctant jeremiad from one of the environmental movement&#x2019;s elder statesmen, <i>The Vanishing Face of Gaia</i> offers an essential wake-up call for the human race.<br> &nbsp;</p></p><p><b>James Lovelock</b> is the author of more than two hundred scientific papers and the originator of the Gaia Hypothesis (now Gaia Theory) on which he has written several books. Since 1994 he has been an honorary visiting fellow of Green College, University of Oxford. In September 2005, <i>Prospect</i> magazine named him as one of the world's top 100 global public intellectuals. He lives in Louceston, England.In his sixth book on Gaia, the eminent 91-year-old British scientist who originated the Gaia Theory to explain the interconnectedness between our planet's climate and life takes an elegiac tone and cosmic perspective in predicting our near future. Challenging the scientific consensus of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, he believes it is too late to reverse global warming. We must accept that Earth is moving inexorably into a long-term "hot state." Most humans will die off, and we must prepare havens like northern Canada, where some climate refugees can survive. Lovelock rejects the results of climate computer modeling when they clash with scientific observation. For example, he points out that sea levels are rising significantly faster than models predicted. Lovelock advocates solar thermal and nuclear power as the best substitutes for burning fossil fuels, and he suggests emergency global geoengineering projects that might cool the planet. But Lovelock also avows today's ecological efforts are futile. This is a somber prophecy written with an authority that cannot be dismissed.

As a science journalist covering the competition, Foer became captivated by the secrets of the competitors, like how the current world memory champion, Ben Pridmore, could memorize the exact order of 1,528 digits in an hour. He met with individuals whose memories are truly unique&#x2014;from one man whose memory only extends back to his most recent thought, to another who can memorize complex mathematical formulas without knowing any math. Brains remember visual imagery but have a harder time with other information, like lists, and so with the help of experts, Foer learned how to transform the kinds of memories he forgot into the kind his brain remembered naturally. The techniques he mastered made it easier to remember information, and Foer's story demonstrates that the tricks of the masters are accessible to anyone. <br> <em>--Miriam Landis</em> <br> <br> <strong>Author Q&amp;A with Joshua Foer</strong> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> First, can you explain the title of you book, <em>Moonwalking with Einstein</em>?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The title refers to a memory device I used in the US Memory Championship&#x2014;specifically it's a mnemonic that helped me memorize a deck of playing cards. Moonwalking with Einstein works as a mnemonic because it's such a goofy image. Things that are weird or colorful are the most memorable. If you try to picture Albert Einstein sliding backwards across a dance floor wearing penny loafers and a diamond glove, that's pretty much unforgettable.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the U.S. Memory Championships? How did you become involved?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The U.S. Memory Championship is a rather bizarre contest held each spring in New York City, in which people get together to see who can remember the most names of strangers, the most lines of poetry, the most random digits. I went to the event as a science journalist, to cover what I assumed would be the Super Bowl of savants. But when I talked to the competitors, they told me something really interesting. They weren't savants. And they didn't have photographic memories. Rather, they'd trained their memories using ancient techniques. They said anyone could do it. I was skeptical. Frankly, I didn't believe them. I said, well, if anyone can do it, could you teach me? A guy named Ed Cooke, who has one of the best trained memories in the world, took me under his wing and taught me everything he knew about memory techniques. A year later I came back to the contest, this time to try and compete, as a sort of exercise in participatory journalism. I was curious simply to see how well I'd do, but I ended up winning the contest. That really wasn't supposed to happen.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What was the most surprising thing you found out about yourself competing in the Memory Championships?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> In the process of studying these techniques, I learned something remarkable: that there's far more potential in our minds than we often give them credit for. I'm not just talking about the fact that it's possible to memorize lots of information using memory techniques. I'm talking about a lesson that is more general, and in a way much bigger: that it's possible, with training and hard work, to teach oneself to do something that might seem really difficult.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can you explain the "OK Plateau?"</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The OK Plateau is that place we all get to where we just stop getting better at something. Take typing, for example. You might type and type and type all day long, but once you reach a certain level, you just never get appreciably faster at it. That's because it's become automatic. You've moved it to the back of your mind's filing cabinet. If you want to become a faster typer, it's possible, of course. But you've got to bring the task back under your conscious control. You've got to push yourself past where you're comfortable. You have to watch yourself fail and learn from your mistakes. That's the way to get better at anything. And it's how I improved my memory.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you mean by saying there an "art" to memory?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The "art of memory" refers to a set of techniques that were invented in ancient Greece. These are the same techniques that Cicero used to memorize his speeches, and that medieval scholars used to memorize entire books. The "art" is in creating imagery in your mind that is so unusual, so colorful, so unlike anything you've ever seen before that it's unlikely to be forgotten. That's why mnemonists like to say that their skills are as much about creativity as memory.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you think technology has affected how and what we remember?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Once upon a time people invested in their memories, they cultivated them. They studiously furnished their minds. They remembered. Today, of course, we've got books, and computers and smart phones to hold our memories for us. We've outsourced our memories to external devices. The result is that we no longer trust our memories. We see every small forgotten thing as evidence that they're failing us altogether. We've forgotten how to remember.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the connection between memory and our sense of time?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> As we get older, life seems to fly by faster and faster. That's because we structure our experience of time around memories. We remember events in relation to other events. But as we get older, and our experiences become less unique, our memories can blend together. If yesterday's lunch is indistinguishable from the one you ate the day before, it'll end up being forgotten. That's why it's so hard to remember meals. In the same way, if you're not doing things that are unique and different and memorable, this year can come to resemble the last, and end up being just as forgettable as yesterday's lunch. That's why it's so important to pack your life with interesting experiences that make your life memorable, and provide a texture to the passage of time.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How is your memory now?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Ironically, not much better than when I started this whole journey. The techniques I learned, and used in the memory contest, are great for remembering structured information like shopping lists or phone numbers, but they don't improve any sort of underlying, generalizable memory ability. Unfortunately, I still misplace my car keys.</p> <p>(Photo of Joshua Foer � Emil Salman Haaretz)</p>Joshua Foer studied evolutionary biology at Yale University and is now a freelance science journalist, writing for National Geographic and The New York Times among others. Researching an article on the US Memory Championships, Foer became intrigued by the potential of his own memory. After just one year of training, he won the following year&#39;s Championship.</p><h2>Craftivism: The Art of Craft and Activism</h2><p>Craftivism is a worldwide movement that operates at the intersection where craft and activism meet; <i>Craftivism</i> the book is full of inspiration for crafters who want to create works that add to the greater good.

I ignored it.<br> <br>Five yards up the shoreline, a rusted red moped sat beneath a precociously flowering tree. The license plate was unreadable from where I stood. At least with my eyes.<br> <br>Dual rearview mirrors. Kickstand. Raised trunk behind the seat. The thing reminded me of my freshman undergrad wheels. I&#x2019;d loved that scooter.<br> <br>Walking the area between the skiff and the moped, I saw a set of tire treads consistent with the pickup parked by the road, and one tread line consistent with the moped itself. No foot or boot prints. No cigarette butts, aluminum cans, condoms, or candy wrappers. No litter of any kind.<br> <br>Moving back along the water, I continued recording observations. The engine sounds grew louder.<br> <br>Mud-rimmed pond, shallow, no tides or chop. Apple trees within five feet of the bank. Ten yards to a gravel road accessing Highway 219.<br> <br>Tires crunched. The engine sounds cut out. Car doors opened, slammed. Male voices spoke French.<br> <br>Satisfied I&#x2019;d learn nothing further from the scene, and wanting a word with the industrious Agent Bandau, I turned and walked toward the vehicles lining the road.<br> <br>A black van had joined Ryan&#x2019;s Jeep, the blue crime-scene truck, the fisherman&#x2019;s pickup, and Bandau&#x2019;s SQ cruiser. Yellow letters on the van said Bureau du coroner.<br> <br>I recognized the van&#x2019;s driver, an autopsy tech named Gilles Pomerleau. Riding shotgun was my new assistant, Roch Lauzon.<br> <br>Exchanging bonjours, I assured Pomerleau and Lauzon the wait wouldn&#x2019;t be long. They crossed to view the corpse. Ryan remained in the cruiser with the unfortunate angler.<br> <br>I approached Bandau, a gangly twentysomething with a wheat blond mustache and skin that looked like it really hated sun. Though it was hidden by his agent&#x2019;s cap, I envisioned pale hair going south at a rate that alarmed its young owner.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s with the plastic wrap?&#x201d; Bandau asked in French, looking past me toward the corpse.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good question.&#x201d; I had no explanation.<br> <br>&#x201c;Male or female?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Bandau&#x2019;s face came around, winking my reflection off his aviator shades. My expression was not a happy one.<br> <br>&#x201c;I understand you were the first responder.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bandau nodded, eyes unreadable behind the dark lenses.<br> <br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d that go?&#x201d;<br> <br>Bandau cocked his chin toward his cruiser. &#x201c;Local named Gripper found the vic. Claims he was fishing when he saw the canoe. He motored over to investigate, something snagged his propeller. Says he paddled in, saw his catch was a corpse, dialed nine-one-one on his cell. While waiting, he dragged the body ashore then retrieved the canoe.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thorough guy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Guess you could say that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is he believable?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>Bandau shrugged. Who knows?<br> <br>&#x201c;What are his creds?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Lives on avenue Margaret with his wife. Works maintenance at the wildlife park.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hemmingford is located in the Mont�r�gie region, a hair from the Canada-U.S. border. The Mont�r�gie is noted for apples, maple syrup, and Parc Safari, a combination drive-through nature preserve and amusement park.<br> <br>When I first started commuting to Quebec, the media were following the story of a group of rhesus monkey escapees from the park. I had visions of the band belly-crawling south through the night to avoid border patrol, risking all for a green card and a better life. Twenty years later, the image still amuses me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I caught the call around noon, drove out, secured the area.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And printed the body.&#x201d; Chilly.<br> <br>Sensing my disapproval, Bandau spread his feet and thumb-hooked his belt. &#x201c;I thought it might speed the ID.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You cut the plastic.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wore gloves.&#x201d; Defensive. &#x201c;Look, I had the new camera, so I shot close-ups and transmitted the file electronically.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You compromised the scene.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What scene? The guy was bobbing in a pond.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The flies will chip in to buy you a beer. Especially the ladies. They&#x2019;re ovipositing with glee as we speak.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was trying to help.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You broke protocol.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bandau&#x2019;s lips tightened.<br> <br>&#x201c;What happened with the prints?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I got ridge patterning on all five digits. Someone at the post sent the file to CPIC. From there it went into both NCIC and the New York State system.&#x201d;<br> <br>CPIC is the Canadian Police Information Centre, a computerized index of criminal justice information. NCIC is the U.S. equivalent, the FBI&#x2019;s National Crime Information Center.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why send the prints south?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Being on the border, we get a lot of Americans coming through. And the scooter has a New York plate.&#x201d;<br> <br>Not bad, Bandau.<br> <br>Hearing a car door slam, we both turned.<br> <br>Ryan was walking toward us. Released for the moment, Gripper was leaning on his pickup, looking uneasy.<br> <br>Ryan nodded to Bandau, spoke to me.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Guy&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Guy?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Based solely on size.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How long?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tough to say. Given this week&#x2019;s warm temperatures, and the shrink-wrap, I&#x2019;d guess a day or two. There&#x2019;s some decomp, but not much.&#x201d; I cast a meaningful glance at Bandau. &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll change now that the bugs have been issued a gate pass.&#x201d;<br> <br>I told Ryan what Bandau had done.<br> <br>&#x201c;What kind of rookie move was that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Bandau&#x2019;s cheeks went raspberry.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s no way to make it up the chain, son.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ryan turned back to me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Twenty-four to forty-eight hours tracks with the wit&#x2019;s account. Gripper says he comes out here on his days off, usually Tuesdays and Thursdays. Swears day before yesterday the pond was canoe and corpse free.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Algae patterning suggests the body was floating with the head just at or below the waterline,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Ryan nodded. &#x201c;According to Gripper, the body was hanging head up in the water, with the booted foot attached to a rock lying on the bottom. He guesses the pond&#x2019;s about eight feet deep where he found the guy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where was the canoe?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Beside the vic. Gripper says that&#x2019;s how the rope got tangled in his outboard.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ryan spoke to Bandau. &#x201c;Check for feedback on those prints.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ryan and I watched Bandau lope toward his cruiser.<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably DVRs cop shows,&#x201d; Ryan said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not the right ones,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Ryan glanced toward the body, back to me.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Weird one,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Suicide? Accident? Murder?&#x201d;<br> <br>I spread my palms in a &#x201c;who knows&#x201d; gesture.<br> <br>Ryan smiled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I bring you along.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The vic probably kept the canoe at the pond and drove the moped back and forth.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Back and forth from where?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Beats me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yep. Can&#x2019;t do without you.&#x201d;<br> <br>A wood thrush trilled overhead. Another answered. The cheerful exchange was in stark contrast to the grim conversation below.<br> <br>As I glanced up, hurried footsteps startled the birds into flight.<br> <br>&#x201c;Got him.&#x201d; Bandau&#x2019;s aviators were now hanging by one bow from his pocket. &#x201c;Cold hit in the States.

It was written in 1964, at the request of the company chairman, to better instruct their Chinese cooks in cooking fresh and flavoursome food. In a few short chapters, Patience Gray lays out a whole repertoire, drawn mainly from the Mediterranean and France, that might be cooked on board ships. Her aim was to wean the cooks off frozen, dried and packeted food and to respond to both the seasons and the supplies available at ports of call. The style of cookery was much as in her earlier, and first, book Plats du Jour (1957): retro to us, bourgeois French in another form of shorthand. The style of writing is eloquent and prescriptive: the author keen to impart good habits as well as good cooking. Thus there are chapters about equipment and kitchen basics as well as mere recipes. The text has been illustrated by Miranda Gray, the author&#x2019;s daughter. Many of the pictures, just as the title, draw on Greek mythology. The reason for this is the Blue Funnel Line&#x2019;s custom of naming its ships for mythological figures (Centaur, Ariadne, Neptune, etc). Other drawings evoke the author&#x2019;s life beside the Mediterranean in Italy and the Greek isles.</p><p>Patience Gray is the famed author of Honey From a Weed, and died in 2005. Her work has always been the intellectual acme of the cookery-book world. Although her output was tiny, her fame is infinite.</p><h2>For Laughing Out Loud: Poems to Tickle Your Funnybone</h2><p>Illus. in full color. "These nonsense verses combine the domestic and the gross, deadpan and slapstick, with a lilting rhythm and satisfying rhyme. The poets are well-known contemporaries including Prelutsky, Silverstein, Kuskin, Lobel, Viorst, and many more. The design is ebullient. Start or end story hour with these verses, and kids will know reading's a pleasure."--(starred) <i>Booklist.</i></p><p>Jack Prelutsky was born in Brooklyn, New York.&nbsp;&nbsp;He attended New York City Public Schools and studied voice at the High School of Music and Art.&nbsp;&nbsp;He enrolled in Hunter College in Manhattan but left soon after "to become a beatnik".&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack has been a cab driver, a busboy, a photographer, a furniture mover, a potter, and a folk singer.&nbsp;&nbsp;He enjoys bicycling, playing racquetball, woodworking and cooking.&nbsp;&nbsp;He lives in Washington State with his wife Carolynn and a vast collection of poetry books and frogs in every shape, size, and form -- except living!&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time when Jack couldn't stand poetry.&nbsp;&nbsp;In grade school he had a teacher who left him with the impression that poetry was the literary equivalent of liver.&nbsp;&nbsp;He rediscovered poetry in his twenties, and he decided that he would write about things that kids really cared about, and that he would strive to make poetry delightful.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been writing poetry for more than twenty years and has published more than three dozen books for children.Prelutsky introduces this volume of humorous poems with a verse of his own: "If you have got a funnybone, / and I've no doubt you do, / then this completely silly book / is sure to tickle you." The poems are silly, full of high jinksstet spelling per Web. and clever nonsense. Although the author and title indexes at the end of the book are useful, a table of contents would have clarified the book's loose organization. A verse about Bella's new umbrella is followed by one about ghouls' ghoul-oshes. Poems about nuts, noodles and bananas fill one double-page spread while verses about rattlesnake meat, jellyfish stew and eating eels occupy another. Priceman's ( Friend or Frog ; Rachel Fister's Blister ) slapdash watercolor illustrations are full of energy and high spirits, perfectly suited to this eclectic collection that includes work by such favorites as Nash, Lobel, Kennedy, Kuskin, Yolen and Raskin.

The former editor of American Heritage magazine, he is the winner of many awards, including the Parkman Prize for history and the National Book Critics Circle Award. He lives in New York.Margaret Lynch Suckley, or "Daisy" as she was fondly called by Franklin Roosevelt, was the president's closest companion during his final years. Shortly after her death at age 100 in 1991, friends discovered her secret diary, many letters she wrote to FDR, and the 38 letters he wrote to her. Suckley's papers, skillfully edited by Roosevelt biographer Ward, reveal a mutual relationship of love, trust, and discretion, unlikely to be found in today's kiss-and-tell memoirs. As a confidante and probable lover, Daisy was unconditionally trusted by Roosevelt. He even informed her of the plans for the D-Day invasion. However, much of Daisy's diaries and letters to and from FDR deal with less pressing concerns?descriptions of seasonal changes, parties, FDR's cruises, and the antics of the Scottish terrier Fala, a gift from Daisy. These entries are repetitive and often tedious. More fascinating are the anecdotes about Churchill and Roosevelt and FDR's sad decline and death in 1945. Suckley's writings show a relaxed, not often documented, side of FDR and a likable, modest woman who lived for and loved Roosevelt.

"Fierce fighting rocks capital of Aztecs." "Fire devastates London." "Horseless carriage frightens the cattle." "Clinton survives impeachment." <i>The Millennium Year by Year</i> tells the history of the last thousand years in the form of modern newspaper articles. The articles cover everything from military history, political changes, and scientific discoveries to cultural milestones and obituary notices. For example, headlines from 1949 include: "Russians have the atomic bomb," "Pauling describes sickle cell anaemia," "Orwell's book foresees a grim 1984," "China establishes People's Republic," and "Actor Ronald Reagan earns more than the U.S. president."<p> This lavishly illustrated book is difficult to put down--not surprising, when each turn of the page reveals gems like "Glass discs offer new eyes for old," "Bavarian sells brown jeans to U.S. miners," and "Black powder is changing warfare" ("A black powder invented in China is likely to revolutionise the nature of warfare for ever"). Some of the choices are odd; it's unlikely that an artist who had sold only one painting would be remembered in the newspapers: "Van Gogh, beset by gloom, kills himself" ("one day his mystical and original art may become fashionable, although it seems unlikely today"). That said, <i>The Millennium Year by Year</i> is a beautiful book, perfect for browsing, that will thrill any history buff. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p></p><h2>Junk Genius: Stylish ways to repurpose everyday objects, with over 80 projects and ideas</h2><p>In Junk Genius, you&#x2019;ll find highly rewarding and money-saving repurposing projects, and discover why making your own is a trend well worth exploring.<br><br>Juliette Goggin and Stacy Sirk have created over 40 projects using items you can easily find or might already have.

The family awaits Oliver&#39;s conclusions with both dread and cautious hope. But along the way, he&#39;ll expose some extraordinary deceptions that lay bare the long-hidden secrets at the dark heart of a highborn family.</p><p>Aaron Elkins is the author of the Edgar Award-winning Gideon Oliver mysteriesSet in the charming village of Stresa on Italy's Lake Maggiore, Elkins's 11th mystery to feature Gideon Oliver (after 2000's Edgar-winning Skeleton Dance) shows the forensic anthropologist in fine form. Oliver's half-Italian friend Phil Boyajian decides to combine a visit to relatives with a tour he's organizing, and invites Oliver and his wife to come along. As fate would have it&#x2014;and Elkins is so good at acknowledging mystery conventions, often tongue-in-cheek&#x2014;Phil's cousin, the bratty Achille de Grazia, has just been kidnapped. The local official, Colonnello Tullio Caravale, doesn't welcome Oliver's advice until an old set of bones turns up. Caravale, in a gently presented but highly amusing detail, admits that he once spent six hours classifying bones only to be told they were not human but rabbit. He's willing, therefore, to accept Oliver's expert help, and their evolving relationship is nicely evoked. The bones are identified as belonging to the kidnapped boy's grandfather, who was presumed dead in a sailing accident 10 years earlier. Clearly the two crimes are related, and the most likely suspects are the eccentric members of the de Grazia family, who live on a private island in a life of supreme physical ease but excruciating psychological discomfort. The distinct personalities of the de Grazias and other characters are sketched with great efficiency and precision. That alone would keep a reader's interest, but the forensic facts Elkins chooses to include and the brisk pace of the plot make for a total success. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The colonies are linked together by the occasional sublight colony ship voyages and hyperspatial data-casting. Human consciousness is digitally freighted between the stars and downloaded into bodies as a matter of course. But some things never change. So when ex-envoy, now-convict Takeshi Kovacs has his consciousness and skills downloaded into the body of a nicotine-addicted ex-thug and presented with a catch-22 offer, he really shouldn&#39;t be surprised. Contracted by a billionaire to discover who murdered his last body, Kovacs is drawn into a terrifying conspiracy that stretches across known space and to the very top of society. For a first-time SF writer to be so surely in command of narrative and technology, so brilliant at world-building, so able to write such readable and enjoyable SF adventure, is simply extraordinary.</p><p>In the twenty-fifth century, humankind has spread throughout the galaxy, monitored by the watchful eye of the U.N. While divisions in race, religion, and class still exist, advances in technology have redefined life itself. Now, assuming one can afford the expensive procedure, a person's consciousness can be stored in a cortical stack at the base of the brain and easily downloaded into a new body (or "sleeve") making death nothing more than a minor blip on a screen. <br>Ex-U.N. envoy Takeshi Kovacs has been killed before, but his last death was particularly painful. Dispatched one hundred eighty light-years from home, re-sleeved into a body in Bay City (formerly San Francisco, now with a rusted, dilapidated Golden Gate Bridge), Kovacs is thrown into the dark heart of a shady, far-reaching conspiracy that is vicious even by the standards of a society that treats "existence" as something that can be bought and sold. For Kovacs, the shell that blew a hole in his chest was only the beginning. . . .&#x201c;This seamless marriage of hardcore cyberpunk and hard-boiled detective tale is an astonishing first novel.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2014;London Times<br><br></i>&#x201c;AN ASTONISHING PIECE OF WORK . . .

These images, appearing together here for the first time in print, constitute an amazing body of photojournalism created under the most adverse circumstances imaginable. As this book reveals, however, they are far more than visual reportage; they also are images of great artistry that capture the life-and-death drama that was played out against an arctic landscape of magnificent and terrible beauty. The story told here through Frank Hurley&#39;s lens began in the summer of 1914, when Shackleton and his crew set sail from England with the intention of being the first to cross Antarctica from one coast to the other, passing through the South Pole on the way. After five months they reached the freezing Weddell Sea and were within sight of land when the Endurance became trapped in the ice pack. Nine months later, the ship was finally crushed, leaving the crew stranded on drifting ice floes at the end of the earth.</p><p></p><h2>The Thinga-ma-jigger is Coming Today!

The Louvre Palace was expanded, Notre-Dame Cathedral was restored and the French masterpiece of the Second Empire, the <i>Op�ra Garnier</i>, was built. A very large part of what we see when we visit Paris today originates from this short span of twenty-two years.</p><p>The vision for the new Nineteenth Century Paris belonged to Napoleon III, who had led a long and difficult climb to absolute power. But his plans faltered until he brought in a civil servant, Georges-Eug�ne Haussmann, to take charge of the implementation. Heedless of controversy, at tremendous cost, Haussmann pressed ahead with the giant undertaking until, in 1870, his political enemies brought him down, just months before the collapse of the whole regime brought about the end of an era.</p><p><i>Paris Reborn</i> is a must-read for anyone who ever wondered how Paris, the city universally admired as a standard of urban beauty, became what it is.</p></p><p><p>STEPHANE KIRKLAND holds advanced degrees in architecture and art history and has worked as an architect and as a consultant. He now shares his time between Brooklyn and Paris, writing about architecture, urban planning, and history.</p><p>&#x201c;In the course of two decades in the mid-nineteenth century, Paris was transformed from a medieval town into a modern city. . . an astonishing makeover, which displaced three hunred and fifty thousand Parisians and razed most of the historic city. . . .

Kirkland clearly knows Paris intimately, writes lucid and engaging prose, and is both spirited in his advocacy of Napoleon III and clear-eyed about how he was able to do what he did. . . . In the end Kirkland tells a cautionary tale. While it is an immense pleasure to accompany him as he leads us through the planning and building of the great boulevards, the construction of the Opera House and the reconstruction of the Louvre, it is also sobering to realize that in the process of gaining much, Paris lost much as well, in particular medieval neighborhoods that had profoundly influenced the city's character.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Washington Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;Scrupulously researched . . .

Kirkland is an able navigator of architectural history--vivid descriptions abound, and the evolution of the city's infrastructure, public spaces, and other amenities is a testament to the oft overlooked reign of Napoleon III. Lovers of the City of Light and urban planners alike will find Kirkland's survey illuminating.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;Stephane Kirkland succeeds in linking strands of politics and finance, to those of history, art and beauty, with a skill that lends his book a most contemporary cutting edge.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Alistair Horne, author of Seven Ages of Paris</i></p><p>&#x201c;Destined to become a classic . . .

Ideal for reading aloud during an Egyptian unit, in music classes, to children attending the opera, or for the pure aesthetic experience.&#x201d;--<i>Booklist</i><br></p><p>There&#39;s no voice like that of opera singer Leontyne Price, and in this retelling of Aida, published in paperback for the first time, we discover that her writer&#39;s voice is equally moving. This tale of the Ethiopian princess-turned-slave, her soldier lover, and their inevitable tragedy is a favorite of Price, who reveals her feeling of sisterhood with the doomed Aida in the book&#39;s afterword. Price brings just enough distance to this story of love, jealousy, war, envy, and suicide to temper her passion. Telling the tale of Aida, one of the world&#39;s most famous--and tragic--operas, in appropriate language and tone is a task to which Price is more than equal.No Bio</p><h2>French Chef Cookbook, The</h2><p>The recipes and techniques demonstrated on Julia Child&#39;s television program are presented in chronological order</p><p>Over a ten years ago I was working at a posh restaurant in New York, The China Grill as a waitress.

Instead, he proposes a theory of human evolution and history based on &#x201c;entanglement,&#x201d; the ever-increasing mutual dependency between humans and things.<br><br> Not only do humans become dependent on things, Hodder asserts, but things become dependent on humans, requiring an endless succession of new innovations. It is this mutual dependency that creates the dominant trend in both cultural and genetic evolution. He selects a small number of cases, ranging in significance from the invention of the wheel down to Christmas tree lights, to show how entanglement has created webs of human-thing dependency that encircle the world and limit our responses to global crises.</p><p><b>Ian Hodder</b> is an archaeologist and professor of anthropology at Stanford University. His most recent books are <i>Entangled: An Archaeology of the Relationships Between Humans</i> and <i>Studies in Human-Thing</i><i>Entanglement.</i>"Hodder&#x2019;s book adds substantially to the case for the importance of coevolutionary relationships in human evolution. In summary, this book will be a valuable addition to college courses in fields such as anthropology and history, and the book's ease of presentation make it accessible and engaging to general readers."&#x2014;M. J. O'Brien, <i>Choice</i><br>"In this important book, Ian Hodder demonstrates why things matter, not because they represent something, but because the entangled interdependence of all things gives rise to the forward direction of history."&#x2014;John C.

And on the cover unfolded Saul Steinberg's vision of the world: New York City, the Hudson River, and then...well, it's really just a bunch of stuff you needn't concern yourself with. Steinberg's brilliant depiction of the world according to self-satisfied New Yorkers placed him squarely in the pantheon of the magazine's&#x2014;and the era's&#x2014;most celebrated artists. <br>&nbsp;<br>But if you look beyond the searing wit and stunning artistry, you'll find one of the most fascinating lives of the twentieth century. Born in Romania, Steinberg was educated in Milan and&nbsp;was already famous for his satirical drawings when World War II forced him to immigrate to the United States. On a single day, Steinberg became a US citizen, a commissioned officer in the US Navy, and a member of the OSS, assigned to spy in China, North Africa, and Italy. After the war ended, he returned to America and to his art. He quickly gained entree into influential circles that included Saul Bellow, Vladimir Nabokov, Willem de Kooning, and Le Corbusier. His wife was the artist Hedda Sterne, from whom he&nbsp;separated in 1960 but never divorced and with whom he remained in daily contact for the rest of&nbsp;his life. This conveniently freed him up to amass a coterie of young mistresses and lovers. But his truly great love was the United States, where&nbsp;he traveled extensively by bus, train, and car, drawing, observing, and writing. <br>&nbsp;<br>His body of work is staggering and influential in ways we may not yet even be able to fully grasp, quite possibly because there has not been a full-scale biography of him until now.&nbsp;Deirdre Bair had access to 177 boxes of documents and more than 400 drawings. In addition, she conducted several hundred personal interviews. Steinberg's curious talent for creating myths about himself did not make her job&nbsp;an easy one, but the result is a stunning achievement&nbsp;to admire and enjoy.</p></p><p><p>DEIRDRE BAIR received the National Book Award for <i>Samuel Beckett: A Biography</i>. Her biographies of Simone de Beauvoir and Carl Jung were finalists for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize. Her biographies of Simone de Beauvoir and&nbsp;Ana�s Nin&nbsp;were chosen by <i>The New York Times</i> as Best Book of the Year (Beauvoir) and Notable Book of the Year (Nin).</p><p><b>Author's Note<br></b><br>Like many other&nbsp;Americans in the last half of the twentieth century, I grew up eagerly awaiting the arrival of <i>The New Yorker </i>each week. Back when there was no table of contents, I think a lot of people must have done as I did, flipping through the pages to scan the titles of articles and glance at the end to see who wrote them while reserving my initial attention for the drawings and cartoons. And from the quantity of fan mail the magazine received, I don&#x2019;t think I was the only one who stopped fanning the pages to study whatever Saul Steinberg contributed to an issue. His work always got my attention, and nine times out of ten, my first response was the same puzzled question: Just what did he mean by <i>that</i>? All those numbers, letters, squiggles, and curlicues; those funny animals and ferocious figures; the brutalist buildings, tranquil landscapes, and chaotic street scenes&#x2014;what was he getting at? And as for <i>that </i>poster, the iconic &#x201c;View of the World from 9th Avenue,&#x201d; dubbed by me and countless others &#x201c;The New Yorker&#x2019;s View of the World,&#x201d; I am sure I was among the first delighted buyers who rushed&nbsp; to the store on Madison Avenue for a copy, which has hung in every house I&#x2019;ve lived in since then.<br><br>When I became a university professor, my office bulletin board was festooned with Steinberg&#x2019;s covers, most of them the ones containing words that I used to try to inspire my students to think. There was the one that showed a man standing between two signs, one pointing to &#x201c;before&#x201d; and the other to &#x201c;after.&#x201d; There was the one with all versions of the verb <i>to be</i>, and the one that proclaimed &#x201c;I do,&#x201d; &#x201c;I have,&#x201d; and &#x201c;I am.&#x201d; And whenever assignments were due and I knew I&#x2019;d be deluged by requests for extensions, I&#x2019;d send my students a message by posting one of my favorite cartoons on the office door, of a man who sits behind a desk beaming as the word <i>NO </i>floats above his head and over to the deflated supplicant who sits in front of him.<br><br>In my home office, ever since I was a graduate student in Paris years ago and I went without lunches to buy it, a Steinberg print has hung on the wall where my eyes naturally gravitate when I raise them &nbsp;from my work. It has floated above every desk since the days when my ancient typewriter gave way to a succession of computers, because I always found something soothing in it during my daily search for whatever words or thoughts were eluding me. I still don&#x2019;t know what there is about this print, one of his landscapes from the era of <i>The Passport, </i>that is endlessly fascinating. It just is.<br><br>That vague generality pretty much characterized my overall response to Saul Steinberg&#x2019;s art until early 2007, when I saw two exhibitions of his work, at the Morgan Library and Museum and the Museum of the City of New York. I spent &nbsp;so much time studying the drawings and trying to puzzle out what inspired him to create them that the friends who were with me grew tired of waiting and were about to leave without me when I rushed to tell them how I thought I&#x2019;d found what I&#x2019;d been missing all those years. I had just read a caption that quoted Steinberg as having said, &#x201c;I am a writer who draws.&#x201d; That was it, of course, the elusive key that opened the first of the many doors that led me to spend three magical years searching for an understanding of his oeuvre.<br><br>On my way out of the Morgan Museum, I bought the book that accompanied the exhibition, and when I got home, I put it beside the four books of his drawings that were already on my library shelves. One by one I took them down again, once more finding puzzle and pleasure in equal part. Several months later, when I was packing books and files for a household move, I came across a huge folder left over from my teaching days that contained all the Steinbergiana that had adorned the walls and bulletin boards of my various offices. For the first time I was aware of the variety of his output, from <i>New Yorker </i>covers to product advertisements. I had saved an old Hallmark calendar and one leftover Christmas card from those he drew for the Museum of Modern Art. There was even a photo of a funny-looking fellow with a mustache and black-framed glasses holding a tiny brown paper mask over his nose, who I now knew was Saul Steinberg himself. How many years had I saved all this? It was hard to remember when I started, or even why. I knew nothing about the artist&#x2019;s life when I collected all these things and until that moment had never considered finding out who he was, where he came from, or why he made such an impact on his culture and society. At that time I really believed that I would never write another&nbsp;biography, but thoughts about Saul Steinberg persisted, and almost before I could verbalize what they were, I knew that I wanted to write about him. One thing led to another, and that was the start of this biography. Four years later, the end result is here.<br>&nbsp;<br>2007&#x2013;2011<br>New Haven, Connecticut<br><br><b><br>CHAPTER &nbsp;1</b><br>&nbsp;<br><b>THE AMERICANIZATION OF SAUL STEINBERG </b><br><br>Saul Steinberg&#x2019;s Italian diploma in architecture&nbsp;stated clearly that he was &#x201c;of the Hebrew Race,&#x201d; which meant he was forbidden to work in Milan in 1940. He was a Romanian citizen, but his passport had been canceled, making him a stateless person bound to be rounded&nbsp;up by Mussolini&#x2019;s Fascist police and sent to an internment facility, the Italian version of a concentration camp. Although he was well known for his satirical drawings and cartoons in two of Milan&#x2019;s leading humor newspapers, he lived for several months as a hunted man and never stayed long in any one place.<br>His Italian girlfriend hid him in her room and her friends hid him in theirs; his classmates from school did the same. But Milan was really a small town and difficult to hide in for long. It was only a matter&nbsp;of time until he would oversleep and be arrested in one of the daily 6 a.m. sweeps through the poorer parts of town, then be loaded onto a train with others who had run afoul of the Fascisti and sent to an internment facility. Those on the run heard rumors that suspects who surrendered voluntarily were treated better than those who were caught in the daily raids, and so, on the advice of his friends, Steinberg turned himself in at the neighborhood police station. Shortly after, he was indeed shipped off to an internment facility, Tortoreto.<br><br>The train ride to Tortoreto was the start of a long series of peregrinations that eventually took him from Milan by plane to Lisbon (twice), to Rome by train, to New York via ship, and then to four days in a holding pen on Ellis Island until the ship that took him to exile in the Dominican&nbsp; Republic was ready to sail. A year later, through &nbsp;the intercession of everyone from Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt to his American uncles and cousins, to several finally admitted to the United States. He took his first legal footsteps on American soil in Miami and from there he took a Greyhound bus (one of his favorite modes of travel) to New York.<br><br>Several months later, in one single day, Saul Steinberg became a United States citizen, a commissioned officer in the United States Naval Reserve, and, via the Office of Naval Intelligence, a member of the fledgling OSS (later the CIA) under the auspices of Wild Bill Donovan, who wanted him despite the fact that navy doctors who had examined him declared him both physically and psychologically unfit for service.<br><br>Ensign Saul Steinberg, USNR, was sent to Washington, D.C., for a brief period of training in psychological warfare to prepare for an overseas posting where his considerable knowledge of languages would complement his artistic abilities. Fluent in his native Romanian and Italian, with excellent French and good German, able to get by in Spanish, and with a smattering of Portuguese and comprehensible English, he was sent by his superiors to be a spy in inland China.<br><br>And that, as he was fond of remembering, was the start of the Americanization of Saul Steinberg, and of his lifelong love affair with all things American.<br><br></p></p><h2>The Hero Beowulf</h2><p>The epic warrior from earliest English literature<br><br>Beowulf was always a hero. As a child, he borrowed his father's sword to attack a nest of savage trolls that preyed on travelers. Now a young man, he seeks to defend the Danish king<br>Hrothgar from a monster named Grendel. King Hrothgar asks Beowulf, "Are you not afraid?" Beowulf replies, "Why should I fear? If I am fated to win, then Grendel cannot defeat me. If<br>I am fated to lose, then it has been my destiny since the day I was born." Sure of his role, if not of his success, Beowulf prepares to battle Grendel . . .<br><br>This story of Beowulf is an introduction to the classic confrontation between good and evil, pared to perfection by the author and brought to life in monumental acrylic paintings by the artist.<br></p><p>Eric A. Kimmel and Leonard Everett Fisher have collaborated on Don Quixote and the Windmills. The author lives in Portland, Oregon, and the illustrator lives in Westport, Connecticut.<br>Grade 4-6&#x2013;A great green monster, cool Viking gear, and powerful, concise language mark this book, which should be called <i>Beowulf 1A</i>, since it tells only half of Part One of the poem. Straightening out the epic's chronology, Kimmel begins with Beowulf's youthful exploits as a troll- and serpent-slayer (but not as a marathon swimmer, a boast he defends in the poem). Then the telling moves "across the sea" (a map would be helpful) to Heorot, where Grendel is wreaking havoc. Beowulf disarms to fight fairly with the monster, and after a fierce struggle literally dis-arms him. Grendel sinks, dying, into the muck, and the Danes rejoice: end of tale. Manic mothers are all too common, and maybe too scary: Grendel's Mom's scene is cut, and the dragon that Beowulf dies killing, 50 years later, is not even a shadow on the story. Nor are there any Christian references, which pepper the poem (but probably not the legend it enshrined). Fisher's large-scale compositions, easily visible across a reading group, feature bright tones for sails, shields, and jerkins bracketed by sky and sea (or by a matte gold ground). Grendel is a pustular jade. Kimmel approaches the stylistic markers of the poem too timidly: "swan-road" would be livelier than "the sea," and "sinews snapped and bone-joints burst" better than "Grendel's shoulder burst." But let's hope that a Part Two from these collaborators will provide a chance to paint a dragon and to throw in litotes or kenning.<i>&#x2013;Patricia D.

In 13 eloquent essays, Stoltenberg articulates the first fully argued liberation theory for men that will also liberate women. He argues that male sexual identity is entirely a political and ethical construction whose advantages grow out of injustice. His thesis is, however, ultimately one of hope - that precisely because masculinity is so constructed, it is possible to refuse it, to act against it and to change. A new introduction by the author discusses the roots of his work in the American civil rights and radical feminist movements and distinguishes it from the anti-feminist philosophies underlying the recent tide of reactionary men&#39;s movements.</p><p>The very title suggests pugnacity-a characteristic usually associated with maleness. Employed paradoxically, Stoltmberg's title and agenda could not be further aparL He writes broadly on all the sexual issues and controversies of our time. With great imagination he explores the various components of human sexuality. His liberation is centered in the notion that there are more than two sexes; each of us possesses our own. He also raises interesting questions and deals with them imaginatively. His essay "What is Good Sex?" will make any reader think twice about a simple gymnastic answer. The essays began as speeches and, thus, have an oral "flavor." Since he deals with controversial topics, not everyone will agree with his opinions. (I personally think he is on the wrong track when it comes to pornography.) I doubt that ariyone, however, can deny the validity of his impulses and humanity. He clearly gives great thought to the problems of manhood in a post-sexist society, a society he hopes to help create. His published works here and in the new classic anthology, For Men Against Sexism, will, I hope, play an important part in such an act of recreation. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i>In this collection of 13 essays, radical feminist Stoltenberg speaks openly and explicitly on male sexual identity and its interrelation with rape, war, abortion , homophobia, pornography, and injustice. His premise is that male sexual identity is a political and ethical construction connected to male supremacy. Based mostly on speeches delivered at colleges, community organizations, and regional and national conferences, his essays exhort individuals, especially men, to learn a new ethic and to examine their acts in view of the consequences for others. This book will enlighten, please, and anger readers.<br><i>- Jeris Cassel, Rutgers Univ.
